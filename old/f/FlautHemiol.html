<p>Maclean contains an entry entitled �Hybrid Stops� in which he says:</p>
<blockquote>
These are stops in which the diameter of the pipes remains constant within the
whole range, so that the relative scale is constantly changing, with a 
corresponding variation in the tone quality.  Thus, if the lowest pipe
is of narrow scale, tone will get progressively flutier as it ascends
in pitch; conversely, starting with a wide scale, the higher tones become
more stringy in quality.  Many historians are of the opinion that the
earliest known ranks of pipes were constructed according to this pattern.
<br>
A stop of this kind, called Hemiolfl&ouml;te or Flaut Hemiol, was much
in favor among the Silesian organ-builders of the early seventeenth
century; its curious name is said to be derived from a contraction of
Hemi and Viol, i.e. half a viol!
</blockquote>
<p>
It is not clear how Maclean thought a rank of pipes of constant width
could get stringier as they ascended; this seems patently incorrect.
Wedgwood lists <i>Flaut Hemiol</i> with the following description:
</p>
<blockquote>
8 ft.  A stop which, as the pitch rose, gradually varies its
quality through <a href="../g/Gamba.html">Gamba</a>,
<a href="../s/Salicet.html">Salicet</a>, <a href="Fugara.html">Fugara</a>,
and <a href="Flute.html">Flute</a>.  (See 
<a href="../_apps/Bibliography.html#Hamel1">Hamel<font size=-1>[1]</font></a>,
Vol. III, p. 540.<p>
There was probably as much accident in design in this peculiarity.
The difficult task in voicing modern keen Gambas on a low wind
pressure is to preserve the stringy quality, combined with
proportionate power in the treble.  Some of the late Mr. Thynne's
<a href="../v/Viol.html">Viols</a> became quite fluty in the
upper octaves.  The orchestral 
<a href="FrenchHorn.html">French Horn</a> presents a remarkable
instance of this transition of quality.  Whereas at one time it
was considered the standard of excellency to endeavour - often
with the final result of ruining the stop - to preserve one
quality of tone throughout the compass, now of late years a
wonderful field has been opened in the skilful merging of
one quality into other in different portions of the compass.
Perhaps the most advanced organ in this respect - the one
which suggested this point to the author - is that at
Battersea Polytechnic (Beale & Thynne, voiced by Whiteley).
