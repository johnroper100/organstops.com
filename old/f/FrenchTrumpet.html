<p>While Irwin lists this name as simply a synonym for 
<a href="../t/Trumpet.html">Trompette</a>, a few sources
treat it more specifically.  Skinner writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
a reed of normal scale having parallel or untapered shallots with
full-length openings developing brilliance in the tone.  The French
Trumpet is essentially a low-pressure reed, and its quality is the 
result of efforts to produce power with a light wind, such as could
be developed with a bellows operated by hand or foot power.  The
tone is not well suited to small, unresonant buildings, but in
large buildings with good acoustics will provide a striking brilliance
to the Swell.  The 16' French Trumpet on a 5 inch wind, makes an
ideal double reed for the Swell organ, free from the usual heavy
thickness of the conventional double reed.  A fine example of this
reed will be found in Trinity Church, Boston [Massachusetts, USA].
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding the <i>French Trumpet</i> of the theatre organ, Strony
says:</p>
<blockquote>
This stop appeared on instruments by many builders.  There were as
many different results.  Some examples are very similar in color
to a Wurlitzer <a href="../b/BrassTrumpet.html">Brass Trumpet</a>.
Indeed, the pipes are flared similarly to the Brass Trumpet.
Other examples breathe fire, and lean more toward the
<a href="../p/PostHorn.html">English Post Horn</a>.
</blockquote>
<p>Al Sefl reports that this stop appeared on Wurlitzer's
�Gaumont special� organs going to the United Kingdom, and had a more
traditional construction and scaling than other Wurlitzer trumpets.
Why they chose to label the rank �French� is not completely understood, 
as this same rank was named simply �Trumpet� on their church and home 
installations in the USA.
