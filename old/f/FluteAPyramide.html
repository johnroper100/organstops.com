<p>This stop is listed only by Audsley.
In his <i>Organ Stops and their Artistic Registration</i> he says:</p>
<blockquote>
The term used to designate an open labial stop of 8 ft. and 4 ft. pitch, 
the pipes of which are square and inverted pyramidal in form, resembling 
those of the <a href="../d/Dolcan.html">Dolcan</a> in being larger at the 
top than at the mouth-line, and especially in the pipes of the bass 
octave, which have been made of wood.  The name would be more appropriately 
applied to a stop the pipes of which are directly 
pyramidal; that is, square, and larger at the mouth-line than at the 
top, in this respect resembling the pipes of the 
<a href="../s/Spitzflote.html">Spitzfl&ouml;te</a>, 
<a href="../g/Gemshorn.html">Gemshorn</a>, and 
<a href="../s/Spitzgamba.html">Cone Gamba</a>. 
We have made wood pipes of thie form, having extremely low inverted 
mouths, which, voiced on wind of 2 3/8 inches, yielded exquisite 
tones having a rare combination of imitative flute- and string-tones, 
both of which could be distinctly heard as if fighting for supremacy.
</blockquote>
<p>In <i>The Art of Organ-Building</i> Audsley describes it
as being quadrangular rather than square, and says that its tone
�varies according to the scale, and treatment of the mouth,
but, properly, it should be of a light and singing quality.�
