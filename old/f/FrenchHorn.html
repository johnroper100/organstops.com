While these names suggest a stop imitative of the modern orchestral 
or �French� horn, their meanings are often different.
According to Williams, in the 16th century the names <i>Horn</i> and
<i>Hoorn</i> frequently indicated a <a href="../c/Cornet.html">Cornet</a> 
mixture, especially in the Netherlands and northern France.
Audsley gives us the first known citation of an organ stop named <i>French Horn</i>,
in a 1724 instrument by Renatus Harris at �St. Dionis Backchurch�.
Audsley also reports that the orchestral horn was first used in England in 1720.
Other sources, however, point out that Harris's horns stops, as well as
those of his contemporary Bridge, were of trumpet quality, though slightly
muffled.
</p><p>
Indeed, it was not until the mid-1700's that the technique of �stopping�
a horn with the hand was developed, and with it the characteristic muffled
and mournful tone of the French horn.  Furthermore, this technique was
developed as a means of obtaining notes between the harmonics on a natural
(valveless) horn.  Valves were not invented until around 1815.
Thus, it was not until the 19th century that organ-builders began
attempting to imitate the sound of the �stopped� orchestral horn,
and these attempts did not achieve much success until the beginning
of the twentieth century.
Prior to the 19th century, horn tone meant �open� horn tone rather
than �stopped� horn tone.  This tone is represented in the organ
by the <a href="../w/Waldhorn.html">Waldhorn</a>.
</p><p>
A few noteworthy examples are worth examining in detail.
Bonavia-Hunt, writing in the early 1920's, tells us:
</p>
<blockquote>
Originally the attempt had been made by Mr. John Compton and others
to develop the horn tone from <a href="../o/Oboe.html">oboe</a>
pipes fitted with excessively wide bells (about 6in. diameter at
the top for the 1 ft. pipe).  The great objection to the wide bell
is the amount of soundboard space it occupies.  The latest method
is to voice an ordinary chorus reed (say 4 1/2 in. at CC, 8 ft.)
on the close side on heavy pressure (from 12 in. upwards),
employing double length (harmonic) pipes from tenor F up, with
relatively thick tongues weighted fairly high up the scale, and
�filled-in� shallots.  The chief difficulty associated with close
reed voicing is the tendency of the reed to �choke�, during which
phenomenon the octave note below is heard along with the unison.
By increasing the thickness of the tongue and fitting a baffle
to the head of the shallot (a device introduced by Vincent Willis),
this defect can be obviated.
</blockquote>
<p>
Wedgwood provides a drawing of Compton's <i>French Horn</i>,
the topmost illustration reproduced here.  He gives the dimensions
of treble C as 2' 3" long, and 6" across the bell.
Audsley writes of two other examples:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The most successful Horn which has come under our notice is that
recently produced by the Hook &amp; Hastings Company, organ-builders,
of Kendal Green, Mass. [USA], through whose courtesy we are able to
describe and illustrate the formation of the pipes of the stop.
It will be seen, on referring to [the middle illustration
reproduced here], that the resonator is mainly of the inverted
conical form, but differing from all other resonators of the form,
in being closed at top with a conical cap, soldered on, and having
a slot, with double adjustment for regulating and tuning, cut close
to its upper end, as shown.  It can be readily understood that the
peculiar cap exerts a considerable mellowing effect on the tone in
conjunction with the adjustable slot through which alone the subdued
sound finds fre egress.  The measurements of the pipe are as follows:
The length of the resonator, exclusive of the conical cap, is 2 feet
3-3/4 inches; height of cap internally 5/8 inch.  Length of slot
(subject to alteration) 2-1/16 inches; width 9/16 inch; distance
from top edge of resonator 1-1/2 inches.  The measurements of the
sound-producing portions are: The length of the reed 
(<i>&eacute;schalote</i>) from under side of the block is 1-3/4
inches, the width of the tongue at its free end is 11/32 inch, and 
where it enters the block 3/16 inch.  The reed is of the closed form,
its perforation commencing 5/16 inch from the lower end.
</p><p>
The second noteworthy example is the Horn which Mr. E. M. Skinner,
organ-builder of Boston, Mass., added some years ago to the list
of imitative stops.  The formation and proportions of the pipes of
this stop forcibly illustrate by what very dissimilar treatments
similar results are obtained.  In this case it may be stated that
the resonator, instead of being of large scale and after the
<a href="../t/Trumpet.html">Trumpet</a> model, is extremely slender
and, accordingly, very slightly tapered.  Also unlike that of the
other Horn, it is open at top, and has a short cylindrical portion
carrying an adjustable slide shaded by a partially attached disc
of metal.  The measurements of the tenor C pipe are as follows:
The length of the resonator is 3 feet 3-1/2 inches (subject to
slight alteration), and its internal diameter at top is 1.63 inches.
The measurements of the sound-producing portions are: The length
of the red from under side of the block is 2-3/16 inches; the width
of the tongue at its free end is 7/16 inch, and where it enters the
block 7/32 inch.  The reed is of the closed form, its perforation
being about 1-3/16 inches long, commencing about 3/8 inch from
the lower end.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Audsley provides a drawing of Skinner's <i>Horn</i>, which is
reproduced in the lowermost illustration given here.
This was by no means Skinner's last
word on the subject.  Skinner himself writes:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The first example of the French Horn was made for
an organ built for Grace Chapel, Williams College, Williamstown,
Massachusetts.
</p><p>
The top of the pipe is capped, the tuning slot placed somewhat
below the cap, thereby forming a pocket which varies in proportion
to the diameter.  The depth of the pocket was determined in the
course of developing the character of the stop and is arbitrary,
due to its substantial influence on the tone quality.  The shallot
of the French Horn is one octave larger than that of an 8' Trumpet.
The opening, however, is of normal size and position, which places 
the over-length entirely below it forming a pocket in the lower end
of the shallot.  The combination of a pocket in the top of the pipe
with a pocket in the shallot provides an acoustical range which permits
sharp tuning without loss of stability.  It is well known that the
sharper a reed is tuned the smoother it becomes.  So, in the French
Horn, the pockets allow a smoothness in tuning, productive of that
muted quality so characteristic of the orchestral Horn.  However,
since the �bubble� is present in both instances, a slight reconciliation
is apparently necessary as in the case of the orchestral instrument,
which contributes still further to its orchestral character.  The
cap and upper pocket are the features which provide the veiled
quality to this voice.
</p><p>
When I heard it played for the first time, it exceeded expectations.
It was and is the orchestral voice itself, even to the peculiarity
in attack known as the �bubble�.  In the first instance I made tenor
C with an 8' shallot having a 4' C opening.  This made the
4' C opening the precise size and distance from the block normal to
a 4' C <a href="../t/Tuba.html">Tuba</a>.  In addition to the presence
of the pocket, the shallot is one octave larger than is normal to the
note.  The top of the resonator is capped and the top of the tuning
slot cut well below.  This forms a pocket in the upper end of the pipe
which, at low C, has a depth of six inches.  The cap is of heavy metal
to prevent vibration.  Covering the top is equicalent to muting the
orchestral horn by hand.  The tongues require little weight.
</p><p>
The authenticity of this French Horn depends upon a precise depth of
the pocket at the top of the pipe.  Some builders have provided a
tuning roll at the upper end of the tuning slot at the top of the
resonator by which the depth of the pocket may be varied.  This
unwise expedient makes it easy for uninformed tuners to vary the
pocket.  ...  The French Horn is of normal length throughout.  It
has relatively few weighted tongues which pecularity was most
unexpected, as this of all reeds, is tuned the smoothest at the
tuning wire.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The <i>French Horn</i> of the theatre organ seems not to have differed
dramatically from that of the classical organ.  It was, according to
Strony, included only on larger instruments, the best examples being
by Skinner and Kimball.  Strony also comments that (unusually for the
theatre organ) it is best used without tremulant.
