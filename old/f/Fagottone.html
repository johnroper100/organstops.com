<p>Audsley lists this stop with the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
This term, which has the Italian augmentative ending,
has been used to designate a lingual stop of the
<a href="Fagotto.html">Fagotto</a> family, properly
of 32 ft. pitch, and of a full and impressive voice.
It is a Pedal Organ stop, and practically carries down the 
voice of the <a href="../c/ContraBassoon.html">Contrafagotto</a>,
16 ft., an octave lower.  It has, however, no equivalent in
the orchestra.  An example exists in the Organ of the Church
of San Alessandro, Milan.  The name has also been given to
stops of 16 ft. pitch, the scales of which are larger and the
voices fuller than those of the imitative Contrafagotto.
An example exists in the Swell of the principal Organ in
the Cathedral of Como.
</blockquote>
<p>Irwin also lists the stop, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
A Reed stop of 32' on the pedals, and sometimes also on
the manuals at this profound pitch.  It sounds with a
reedy, distinct quality that is valuable in combination
or alone.  Although it is soft, it is not dull in tone,
and has the advantage of a clear statement of the pitches.
The pedal flue stops are frequently made much more usable
by this Reed, especially if they are crowded or dull in tone.
</blockquote>
<p>The name means �big fagotto� or �big bassoon�.</p>
