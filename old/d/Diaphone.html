<p>
Wind-blown organ pipes come in two broad types: flues and reeds.
While the Diaphone is in many ways similar to reeds, it is considered to
be in a class by itself, sometimes called "valvular".  
Instead of a reed, it employs a beating palette
to produce the vibrations which are amplified and fixed in frequency by
a resonator.  Unlike beating reeds, the pitch of a Diaphone is not
affected by variations in wind pressure.  (This is also true of free reeds.)
Diaphones are uncommon, and are found most often in theatre organs.
Diaphonic pipes are typically only used in the 16' and 32' octaves.
</p>
<p>
Audsley provides a drawing (reproduced here) of the Diaphone in what he 
calls "its simplest form" with the following description:
</p>
<blockquote>
In this treatment we find a likeness to the action of the ordinary striking
reed &mdash; a likeness which is absent in the more complicated Diaphones
in which pneumatic motors are introduced.  A is a quadrangular piece of
hardwood, bored in the manner shown at B, and firmly attached to the block
of the boot C.  From this block rises the resonator, which is either inverted
pyramidal in form an constructed of wood, or inverted conical in form and 
made of stout zinc.  D is a disc-valve, faced with felt and leather, and
carried on the spring E in the manner indicated.  The spring E is forked
in its lower part, and is held firmly between the sliding pieces shown at F.
The spring is regulated by moving these pieces up or down, shortening or
lengthening the effective portion connect with the disc-valve.  The action
of this appliance is simple and resembles that of the ordinary striking
reed.  When compressed air is admitted from the wind-chest into the boot G
it immediately acts on the more exposed surface of the valve D, driving it
against the opening of the bore B.  The valve rebounds under the action of
the spring E, allowing a puff of compressed air to enter the resonator
through B.  The valve is again closed and again opened, and the action
continues so long as the boot is supplied with compressed air.  In this,
as in all other forms of the Diaphone, the rate of vibration of the valve
is controlled by the vibrating column of air within the resonator, and is
not affected by increased pressure in the pipe-wind.
</blockquote>

<h2>History and Development</h2>

<p>
While the invention of the Diaphone is commonly attributed to Robert
Hope-Jones, he was not actually the first to use the principle in an
organ pipe.  Wedgwood writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
It frequently happens in organ building, when the requisite conditions are 
fortuitously complied with, that a pallet will commence to vibrate rapidly,
and it is often within the province of an organist's or organ builder's
observation that such a "fluttering pallet," or a Tremulant in a state of
rapid vibration, when provided with a resonator in the form of a soundboard
or wind trunk, generates tones of considerable power.  The safety valves of
steamboats constantly act similarly. ... The idea must doubtless have occurred
to many builders ... that such phenomena might systematically be adapted to
tonal use.  An experimental attempt at such adaptation was made in 1888 by
Messrs. Blackett &amp; Howden, of Newcastle [England].  The bulk of the
apparatus employed was enclosed in a box (15 ins. square for the 16 ft. note).
Wind passed into a chamber containing a vibrator in the form of a circular
disc fixed on to the loose end of a spring, and so arranged as to beat against
a hole in the under side of the resonator, being regulated in pitch and 
intensity by a sliding bridge and set-screw.
<a href="Diaphone3.png"><img src="Diaphone3$.png" align=right></a>
<p/>
In order to economize space the box was divided into compartments, which were
further partitioned into spiral channels.  The bore of the channels constantly
increased and the apparatus was surmounted by a short bell.  By sundry
modifications of the scaling and wind pressure, and by the adjustment of the
vibrating disc, it was found possible to secure several distinct varieties
of tone quality and degrees of power.
</blockquote>
<p>
It was Hope-Jones who, according to Wedgwood, first developed a really
practical stop of this type.  He began developing Diaphones in 1893,
and in 1894 he took out his first of several patents for stops of this type.
The original form, apparently never actually used by Hope-Jones in an
organ, was later used by another builder for the
<a href="DiaphonicBassoon.html">Diaphonic Bassoon</a>.

The first organ containing a Hope-Jones Diaphone was built in 1896
for Worcester Cathedral, which contained two of these stops, one at
32' pitch and one at 16'.  Wedgwood provides a drawing, reproduced
here, with the following description:
</p>
<blockquote>
M is a [pneumatic] motor, to the tail-piece of which is attached a rod 
bearing the compound and spring valves V, V', working against the springs 
S, S'.  On the admission of wind (under pressure) to the box A, the motor 
M is caused to collapse, and thereby to open the valves V, V'.  Wind then
rushes into the chamber B, and, entering the interior of the motor M
through the passage C, equalizes the pressure on the motor.  The action
of the springs now serves to close the valves V, V', and to open out the
motor M, whereupon the process is repeated.
</blockquote>
<p>
Audsley provides a somewhat more detailed drawing (reproduced here) of
what appears to be the same style of Diaphone.  He describes it as follows:
</p>
<a href="Diaphone2.png"><img src="Diaphone2$.png" align=right></a>
<blockquote>
In [this figure] is given a Longitudinal Section of the mechanical portion
of a large Diaphone, showing the full development of Mr. Hope-Jones' system
of construction.  Diaphones of this kind were inserted in the pedal department
of the Organ in Worcester Cathedral in the year 1895, and in the same
department of the Organ in McEwan Hall, Edinburgh [Scotland], in 1896.
In each case the Diaphone could be drawn of 32 ft. and 16 ft. pitch.
In this form we find the three essential parts of the complete Diaphone,
viz: (1) a valve set into motion by (2) a motor, which is controlled as to
its periodic action by (3) a resonator.  In the Longitudinal Section A is
the boot or chamber into which the pipe-wind is admitted through the hole B.
Formed between the sides of this boot is the channel C, stopped at its lower
end, as indicated, and opening at its upper end into a resonator, which is
planted on the top board of the boot.  D is the motor in the form of a small
cunieform bellows, which is placed in communication with the channel C through
the oblong opening E.  The metal arm F is screwed to the movable board of the
motor, and firmly held between nuts on the tapped valve-stem G.
The valve-stem is supported at its right end by the slender spring H, in the
manner clearly indicated; and at its left end by the spring bar K, to which
is bolted the weight L.  The valve-stem passes air-tight through the leather
purse P.  On the valve-stem are securely fixed with double nuts two 
disc-valves of peculiar construction, the larger one, M, being placed 
outside the channel C, and the smaller one, N, inside the channel, as shown.
Each valve is formed of a disc and a ring of hardwood, connected around
their edges, and about 1/4 inch apart, with leather.  Three small spiral
springs keep the leather edging stretched, while they permit the ring 
portion of the valve to move when the valve strikes its seat in any sudden
fashion.  The ring portion is faced with thick felt protected with a 
covering of leather.  The valve-seats are also covered with felt and
leather.  The peculiar construction of the disc-valves M and N will be
thoroughly understood from the illustration.  The action of the appliance
is as follows: When the compressed air or pipe-wind enters the boot A
through the hole B, which is connected with some sort of wind-chest,
it immediately exerts its pressure on the motor D, collapsing it sufficiently
to move the valve-stem G and open the disc-valves N and M.  A puff of
compressed air instantly passes into the channel C through the valve
ports I and J.  For the instant the air in the channel is compressed
sufficiently to institute what is practically a state of equilibrium
between the air inside and outside the motor D, and the spring bar K
draws the motor open and closes the disc-valves.  The condensation or
puff of compressed air has passed upward into the controlling column
of air in the resonator, breaking the equilibrium just alluded to, and
allowing the pipe-wind to act on the motor, open the disc-valves,
and allow another puff to enter the channel C.  The equilibrium is again
instituted, and the motor expands, and the valves close.  This process
continues with perfect regularity, the period of vibration being practically
determined by the size of the column of air in the resonator.
</blockquote>
<a href="Diaphone4.png"><img src="Diaphone4$.png" align=right></a>
<p>
Another type of Diaphone, developed by Hope-Jones in 1895, is described
by Wedgwood with the illustration reproduced here:
</p>
<blockquote>
Wind enters at the foot A, charges the chamber C, and acts upon the back of
the motor M, in such a manner that this latter is collapsed.  In collapsing
it moves (through the medium of the thong or flat chain B) the roller valve
V, thus allowing the wind in the chamber C to escape through E into the
resonator or pipe P.  Wind, passing through the channel L, acts upon the
motor M in such a manner that the pressure on the inside and outside of the
motor is balanced, and the spring S is at liberty to close the roller valve
V again.  The cyclic process is repeated.  The particular function of the
roller valve in organ work is to admit wind gradually. ... The smoother
the action of the valve, the smoother the tone quality generated.  ...
This Roller-Valve Diaphone is here described mainly on account of its
theoretical interest; it is scarcely a form adapted to practical use.
</blockquote>
<p>
John Compton made further improvements and refinements to the Diaphone,
producing <a href="../t/Tibia.html">Tibia</a>, <a href="http://www.organstops.org/h/Horn.html">Horn</a>,
<a href="../o/OpenDiapason.html">Diapason</a>, and String tones, according to Irwin.
</p>

<h2>Tone and Usage</h2>
<p>
The Diaphone never attained widespread usage, and found a permanent
home only in the theatre organ &mdash; and in lighthouses as a foghorn.
According to Maclean, it proved somewhat unreliable, requiring more careful
and frequent servicing than flues and reeds.  Audsley also questioned its
durability, and claimed that it was almost impossible to secure tonal 
uniformity throughout a rank of Diaphones pipes.
</p><p>
In addition to the tones listed above, Bonavia-Hunt also mentions
<a href="../s/Salicional.html">Salicional</a>, 
<a href="Dulciana.html">Dulciana</a>, 
<a href="../v/Violone.html">Violone</a>, and 
<a href="../t/Trombone.html">Trombone</a> tones as having been
produced by Diaphones, and Wedgwood mentions a diaphonic 
<a href="../c/Clarinet.html">Clarinet</a>
which employed cylindrical resonators.
In general its tone has been described as full, commanding, weighty,
and smooth, though Grove describes it as always unblending.
<p/><p>
Strony reports that on the theatre organ a 
<a href="../o/OpenDiapason.html">Diapason</a> is rarely extended below 
8' C with flue pipes; instead, Diaphone pipes are usually employed
in the 16' and 32' octaves.  Two types of Diaphone are used: metal
and wood, the latter being louder.
