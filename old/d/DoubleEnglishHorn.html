<p>This 16' stop was first described by Wedgwood, who says:</p>
<blockquote>
Invented by Mr. Hope-Jones.  The pipes of the Double English Horn, which
are of thick heavy metal, are of inverted conical shape and are surmounted
by large bells.  They are of full <a href="../o/Oboe.html">Oboe</a> scale.
The tongues are weighted and kept as flat and close to the reed as 
possible.  The shallots are �open� (<i>i.e.,</i> made with parallel
apertures).  The result is a very fiery �free� tone, of great brilliancy
and richness.  Possessing as it does but little body, the tone quality
may be described as a thin blare (in a musical sense).  The Double
English Horn is particularly remarkable for the richness it imparts in
combination.  It is a most effective Swell double reed.  At the same
time its �freedom� of tone renders it scarcely well suited to form the
position (which it has sometimes occupied of the <i>only</i> double stop
in the Swell, a flue double being necessary.  The stop does not resemble
the <a href="../e/EnglishHorn.html">Cor Anglais</a>, and differs as 
much in tone from the ordinary double reeds.  There are good specimens
at the Collegiate Church, Warwick; St. Michael, Chester Square, W.;
and Worcester Cathedral; (Hope-Jones).
</blockquote>
<p>Nearly two decades later, Bonavia-Hunt had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
To substitute for closed shallots to the Willis 
<a href="../c/ContraOboe.html">contra hautboy</a>
can hardly be called an �invention�, nor is the result of such
treatment highly commendable.  A very free-toned double reed
can only at best be serviceable as a special fancy effect,
and the 16ft. <a href="../o/OrchOboe.html">orchestral oboe</a>
would seem to answer the purpose more efficiently.
</blockquote>
<p>On theatre organs, this name refers to a 16'
