<p>Audsley describes this stop as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
A <a href="../o/OpenDiapason.html">Principal or Diapason</a>, 8 ft., of
large scale and short compass, which extends throughout the treble octaves
of the manual compass, or from middle c1 to the top note.  The stop has
very rarely been carried to tenor C.  This short stop was considered of
considerable value by the old German organ-builders, on account of its
power of reinforcing the weaker octaves of the unison foundation-work.
This weakness was so forcibly realized by Christian Muller, that he 
inserted two pipes to each note in the treble of several of the more
important stops in his noble Organ in the Cathedral of Haarlem.  This
matter might, with advantage, recieve serious consideration at the
present time; for the natural weakness of the treble in the Organ still
remains one of its tonal shortcomings.
</blockquote>
<p>In <i>The Art of Organ Building</i>, Audsley describes five ways of 
overcoming weakness in the treble:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duplicating ranks of pipes.  The primary drawback of this approach
	is the possibility of the two ranks diminishing rather than
	augmenting each other due to phase differences.
<li>Increased wind pressure in the upper octaves.  The drawback
	of this approach is the additional space and expense required for
	additional chests and reservoirs.
<li>Enlargement of pipe scales in the upper octaves.  This approach
	is generally a good one, though increasing the scale has a tendency
	to reduce harmonic development, all other things being equal.
<li>Use of harmonic pipes.  This approach is not very useful for
	Diapasons, because harmonic pipes tend towards flute-tone.
	See <a href="../h/HarmonicFlute.html">Harmonic Flute</a>.
<li>�Simple voicing and regulation.�
</ul>
<p>Sumner observes: �The stop is not now made, since proper scalings
are used which prevent the characteristic falling off in power of
the upper octaves of the old 8-ft. diapason stops.�</p>
