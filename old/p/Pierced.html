Listed only by Wedgwood, who says:
<blockquote>
Pierced is a prefix synonymous with �slotted�.  A slot is an opening
cut in the side of the pipe near the top.  When of narrow diameter it
has the effect of weakening the ground tone of large-scaled pipes, and
of rendering them somewhat horny in character.  Small-scaled pipes are
also affected by �slotting�, though not to the same extent.
<a href="../g/Gamba.html">Gambas</a> and <a href="../v/Viol.html">Viols</a>
are generally slotted - as much for the purpose of facilitating tuning
as for anything else.  Sometimes the prefix, Pierced, refers to an
arrangement similar to that described under 
<a href="../k/Keraulophone.html">Keraulophon</a>.  St. Asaph Cathedral
(Hill).  The word was also used by Lewis.  When applied to stopped
pipes, the prefix, Pierced, implies that a hole is bored through the
stopper, in fact, that the pipes belong to the class known as Half-Stopped
Pipes.
