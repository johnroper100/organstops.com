Maclean lists <i>English Post Horn</i> with the following description:
</p>
<blockquote>
Although similar in name to the gentle <a href="../e/EnglishHorn.html">English Horn</a>,
these two stops could hardly be further apart in tonal quality.  The English
Post Horn was originally designed by Hope-Jones as a 16' Reed in his
reconstructed Swell division which, with its weighty flue-work
(<a href="../d/DiapasonPhonon.html">Diapason Phonon</a> and
<a href="../t/TibiaClausa.html">Tibia Clausa</a>), required something
really startling in its Reed chorus by way of contrast.  This function
was admirably fulfilled by his
<a href="../d/DoubleEnglishHorn.html">Double English Horn</a>
(to give it its original name), which at the time it was introduced,
represent the extreme limit of brassy, strident Reed tone, the
quality of which is most aptly described by Wedgwood as a �thin blare�.
At a later period, when Hope-Jones came to design the Wurlitzer Theater organ,
the top found its true vocation, as its tone is predominantly theatrical
in character.  The combination in 8 ft. pitch of the Wurlitzer English
Post Horn with the <a href="../t/TubaMirabilis.html">Tuba Mirabilis</a>,
both on a wind pressure of about twenty-five inches, represents the
nearest possible organ approximation to the tone of orchestral brass
instruments played <i>ff</i>.
</blockquote>
<p>
Strony calls the <i>English Post Horn</i> �the king of theatre organ
chorus reeds�, and reports that it typically appears at 8' pitch, and 
at 16' in the manuals to tenor C, but is sometimes extended down to 16'
for use in the pedal.  He also states that all theatre organs of
greater than 11 or 12 ranks
�MUST have an English Post Horn.  To not have one would be tantamount
to giving an artist all of the primary and secondary colors, except
for red.�
The name <i>English Horn</i> on a theatre organ is a synonym for
<i>English Post Horn</i>, not for <a href="../e/EnglishHorn.html">Cor Anglais</a>.
