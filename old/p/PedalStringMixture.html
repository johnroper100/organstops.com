<p>Listed only by Irwin, who says:</p>
<blockquote>
A pedal <a href="../m/Mixture.html">mixture</a> composed of either the
incisive, small-scale Strings or the larger-scale pipes that sound more
like <a href="../o/OpenDiapason.html">Principals</a>.  This composite
of tone supports the String ancillary or the Swell's Strings.  Little
approach to standardization of design is possible.  The ranks usually
do not break back in pitch as the scale is ascended, whereas manual
ranks do.  This permits the pedal scale to be ascended without changes
in the weight or harmonic structure of the tone.  Third-sounding ranks
are less likely to be seen in pedal mixtures than they are in manual
mixtures, since the pedal tone is more usable as a tone-builder than
as a melody line.  However, the 3-1/5' (or 1-3/5') can be included
in this mixture if a more harmonically complete tone is desired.
These pitches may all be taken from one rank of pipes (although this
is not considered an orthodox procedure) if space or funds do not
warrant individual, �straight� ranks.  In this case special scaling
of the pipes would have to be used by the builder to balance the 
loudness of the tone.
</blockquote>
<p>Irwin understates the case against unifying a mixture: fifth and,
especially, third sounding stops should never be unified from
unison or octave sounding ranks, as they can never be brought
into proper tune.</p>
