Audsley lists <i>Pyramidfl&ouml;te</i> with the synonym
<i>Pyramidal Flute</i> and the following description:
</p>
<blockquote>
A wood stop, of 8 ft. pitch, the pipes of which are square and,
as the name implies, are smaller at the top than at the mouth
line.  The tone differs in stops made by different organ-builders,
but in the best examples it is light and clear, resembling a
combination of the tones of the <a href="../m/Melodia.html">Melodia</a>
and the <a href="../g/Gemshorn.html">Gemshorn</a>.  A good example
exists in the Unterwerk of the Organ in the Church of SS. Peter
and Paul, Liegnitz, in Silesia [Germany], built by Buckow in 1839.
</blockquote>
<p>Wedgwood lists <i>Pyramidfl&ouml;te</i>, saying only �A
variety of <a href="../o/OrchFlute.html">Querfl&ouml;te</a>
of �pyramidal� or tapering structure.  Liegnitz.�.  
Irwin lists <i>Pyramid Flute</i> with this description:
</p>
<blockquote>
An open wood Flute of 16', 8', or 4' pitch, whose pipes are
shaped like the lower sections of very slender pyramids.  The
<a href="../c/ConicalFlute.html">Conical Flute</a>, of similar
form, is usually a little brighter than this Flute, especially
in the treble notes.  The partials of these two Fluts are not
peaked in loudness as they are in many straight-walled metal
and wooden Flutes.  The are also dampened almost out of 
existence by the tapered walls, except down near the fundamental.
Compared to the <a href="../m/MajorFlute.html">Major Open Flute</a>
and <a href="PrincipalFlute.html">Principal Flute</a>, this
is a comparatively dull Flute.  It is chiefly a combinational
or ensemble Flute.
<a href="../f/FluteTriangulaire.html">Triangular Flutes</a> of
tapered form are also made, and are quite dull in tone,
although sometimes loud.  There is little appeal in the tone
of this Flute as a solo stop to sound by itself.
