<p>A rare flute stop of 8' or 16' pitch, invented in 1896 by Hope-Jones,
and made by J. W. Whiteley.
Tonally, it is similar to a soft <a href="../q/Quintaten.html">Quintaton</a>,
but, according to Wedgwood, more stringy.  Bonavia-Hunt reports that the
fundamental and 3rd harmonic are of equal strength; Irwin claims that
the 3rd harmonic is slightly strengthened.
It is made of small-scale metal pipes, either stoppered (according to
Bonavia-Hunt) or capped (according to Irwin).  
Bonavia-Hunt describes it as a stoppered <a href="../v/Viol.html">Viol</a>,
with a roller-bridge set further away from the mouth than is usual
for a viol, and says that it is voiced without the stopper.
Wedgwood reports that the lower octaves are bearded, and that in some
examples the nicking extends only halfway across the languid.
Its mouth is as narrow as 2/11 (Bonavia-Hunt) or 1/6 (Wedgwood).
Wedgwood reports that it was occasionally used as a 
<a href="../c/Celeste.html">celeste</a>, named
<a href="../c/Celestina.html">Celestina</a> by Hope-Jones in some cases, 
and that it was originally
designed as a celeste for use with a <a href="../g/Gedeckt.html">Gedeckt</a>.
A number of 4' examples also reportedly have been made.
</p><p>
Wedgwood gives its etymology as being from the Greek
<i>fon&ecirc;</i> (�sound or voice�) and <i>neuma</i> (�sign�),
or possibly <i>pneuma</i> (�breath or spirit�).
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The only information we have regarding examples of this stop is
provided by Wedgwood, who says:
<blockquote>
St. Mark, Brighton; St. Michael, Chester Square, W. (Hope-Jones);
Burton Parish Church (Norman & Beard and Hope-Jones).  In 16 ft.
pitch, Oakleigh Park Congregational Church (Ingram, Hope-Jones & Co.);
Orchestrell Co, Regent Street, W. (Austin Organ Co., of U.S.A.).
In U.S.A. - First Presbyterian Church, Montclair, N.J. (Austin
Organ Co., Hope-Jones); St. John's School, Manlius, N.Y. (Hope-Jones
and Harrison).
</blockquote>
<p>It is not known whether any examples are still extant.
