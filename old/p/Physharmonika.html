<p>A soft-toned free reed stop of 16' or 8' pitch.
All of the reeds are mounted within a single special wind chest,
sometimes with short resonators, sometimes without.
It is sometimes fed from a separate reservoir whose pressure is under the
control of a pedal at the console, thus allowing expression.
Wedgwood describes the <i>Physharmonika</i> as virtually a set of harmonium 
(reed organ) reeds, and describes the <i>Harmonium</i> stop as being identical
with the <a href="../c/Clavaoline.html">Clavaeoline</a> or <i>Physharmonika</i>.
According to Grove, it was introduced to Germany in the mid-19th century by
Walcker, Ladegast, and other builders.
Williams states that it was popular from around 1810.
Free reeds without resonators are not affected by changes in temperature,
unlike other pipe forms, making it difficult to keep this stop in tune
with the rest of the instrument.
Audsley gives the illustration reproduced below with the following description:

<blockquote>
The best examples of the Physharmonika to be found in modern European
Organs have been made by J. & P. Schiedmayer of Stuttgart [Germany],
through whose courtesy we are able to give an illustration showing
the formation of the stop.  Fig. 29 [reproduced below] is a Transverse
Section of the complete appliance in its most improved form.  A is the
chamber into which the compressed pipe-wind is conducted by a suitable 
wind-trunk or conveyance.  This chamber is connected through the opening
D, with the bellows B, which, together with the chamber A, forms the
compressed-air resevoir.  The bellows B is acted on by the spiral
spring C, which properly regulates the wind-pressure at all times on
the many tongues.  E is a small escape-valve, held against its port by
a light spring.  A Longitudinal Section of a free tongue or vibrator
with its brass frame is shown at F; and its tuning-clip and wire are
shown at G.  The wire passes air-tight through the side of the chamber
A, to enable the tuning to be done from the outside.  H is the reed-groove
special to the vibrator F, furnihed with the pallet-hole I.  J is the
pallet, covering the hole I, and commanded by the key-action of the
Organ through the agency of the rocking-lever K and the pull-wire L.
The pallet is held against its seat by the spring M, which is strong
enough to resist the downwad pressure of the wind on the surface of 
the pallet.  N is the sound-chamber, general to all the reed-grooves:
this is properly made much deeper than is shown.  It is furnished at
its end, or ends, with a pivoted or sliding applicance for <i>crescendo</i>
and <i>diminuendo</i> effects.  The free-reeds of the Physharmonika
are similar in all respects to those used for the ordinary free-reed
stops; the only difference lies in the manner in which they are mounted.

<p>Skinner considers <a href="../h/Harmonica.html">Harmonica</a> 
to be more or less synonymous with <i>Physharmonica</i>.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Osiris contains only two examples, which are listed below.
No examples of <i>Phisharmonika</i> or <i>Seraphine</i> (mentioned
only by Wedgwood) are known.
