<p>Audsley lists this stop with the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
The name that has been employed by French organ-builders to designate
a string-toned labial stop, of 8 ft. pitch, the pipes of which have
conical bodies surmounted by bells (<i>pavillons</i>), similar to
those of the <a href="../b/BellGamba.html">Bell Gamba</a>; and, like
them, tuned by means of large flexible ears.  The pipes were usually
made of tin, and voiced to yield a soft and agreeable string-tone.
The stop has fallen into disuse.
</blockquote>
<p>Irwin also lists it, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
A small-scale String of 8' or 4' on the manuals, with an 
unusally bright but delicate tonality, inclining towards the 
<a href="Viol.html">Viol</a>s in timbre.  Its pipe-form
imparts to it a somewhat compound train of harmonics that is
developed in the extreme heights and also in the range down
near the fundamental.  The pipe-form that accomplishes this
feat is conical and very slender, and each pipe is topped by
a narrow bell that is from one-half to one-eighth of its
speaking length.  The conical portion of the pipe dampens
the middle range of harmonics and slightly increases the
fundamental, usually weak in a String.  The bell strengthens
a fringe of brilliantly high harmonics that generally do not
escape the walls of a cylindrical pipe of the same general
dimensions.  This is a solo and ensemble String.  This stop
is not assertive, as a <a href="../o/OrchViolin.html">Viole d'Orchestre</a>
may be, but easy for other stops of the same pitch to absorb.
The <a href="../b/BellGamba.html">Bell Gamba</a> is of
bigger scale and louder tone.  Tuning thee narrow pipes is
accomplished by bending inward their large ears to flatten,
or outward to sharpen, the pitch.  This rank deserves the
front position on the windchest becaue its myriad of high
partials is easy to lose by absorption.
