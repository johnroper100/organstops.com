A string stop imitative of the orchestral instrument
of the same name, usually of 8' pitch, but occasionally found at 4' or 16'.  
Grove dates it from around 1700 in Germany.
While Wedgwood claims that this stop is rarely found outside the pedal,
nearly one third of the examples in Osiris are manual stops.
Wedgwood describes it as a full-toned <a href="../g/Gamba.html">Gamba</a>,
and Skinner call it the "broadest and richest of all organ strings".
Both wood and metal have been used to construct this stop;
Audsley preferred wood, while Skinner seems to have preferred metal.

<p>
Bonavia-Hunt maintains that the best results are obtained from larger
scales voiced on heavy pressure (e.g. 6").  He provides two scales (in metal):

Audsley gives us the following descriptions of two different wooden
<i>Violoncello</i> stops:
</p>

<a href="Cello1.gif"><img src="Cello1$.gif" align=right></a>
<blockquote>
A Violoncello, 8 ft., of delicate and imitative character is made
with pipes having inverted mouths and a modified form of the
<i>frein harmonique</i>, as shown in [the accompanying drawing].
The drawings aretaken from the CC pipe, made for us by Messrs. 
Peter Conacher &amp; Co., of Huddersfeld, Yorkshire [England].
The scale of the pipe is 2 7/8 inches in width by 3 3/4 inches in
depth, and the height of mouth is 7/8 inch.  The block is sunk
1/2 inch below the mouthl the under lip is sharp and has no
nicking; the cap is straight on the inside and has no nicking;
the upper lip is cut to almost a sharp edge; and the <i>frein
harmonique</i> is a stout plate of hard metal held firmly in
a saw-cut in the upper end of the cap.
The pipe is made of white pine 9/16 inch thick, with the mouth
and cap of black walnut; it has a slot cut in its upper end,
4 inches long by 1 1/8 inches, placed 4 inches from the top.
The pipe is tuned by means of a piece of wood sliding over a
portion of the slot.  The hole in the foot is only 1/2 inch,
but that is ample to supply the pipe.

<blockquote>
Probably the most successful Violoncello, 8 ft., constructed by
an English organ builder, is that invented by Mr. John W.
Whiteley.  A fine example of this stop appears in the Solo division
of the Concert-room Organ in the Polytechnic Institute, Battersea,
London [England].  In the construction and treatment of the pipes
of this valuable stop some novel features obtain, as will be seen
from the drawings and particulars here given &mdash; features which,
in our opinion, point the way to further developments of an
important character.
In the accompanying illustration is shown part of the middle c1
pipe of this stop, the scale of which is 1 inch in width by
1 9/16 inches in depth.  It will be observed from the illustration
that, while the internal dimensions are the same throughout the
length of the pipe, the wood, of which it is formed, is evenly
reduced in thickness toward the top, being 1/4 inch at the block
and only about 1/8 inch thick at the open end.  The result of
this unusual treatment goes to prove that the thickness of the
wood used in pipe-making exercises an influence on the tone
produced. ...
The mouth is cut up one-third of its width, and its upper lip is
reduced to a fine edge.  The lower lip on the block is also sharp,
and has no nicking.  The cap is slightly hollowed on its inside,
also to a somewhat sharp edge, in which a slightly curved wind-way
is cut, and finished with seven small nicks.
A special pculiarity obtains in the manner in which the cylindrical
harmonic-bridge is supported in front of the mouth.  This bridge,
instead of being simply the length of the mouth, and being attached
to small ears, is carried across the entire width of the pipe,
and is supported by two thick spotted-metal plates, which are
screwed to the sides of the pipe.  The front edges of these places
are sloped away from the bridge so as to free the wind in the
neighborhood of the mouth: in deed the entire construction of the
mouth portion of the pipe insures perfect freedom to the under
stram of air which is generated by the rushing wind-sheet of the
mouth.  This is essential to the production of the compound tone
which so closely imitates that of the orchestral Violoncello.
In the larger pipes the harmonic-bridges are made of hardwood,
while in the small pipes they are made of aluminium tubing, held
in position by points punched inward in the metal side-plates.

<p>Williams gives us a description of a reed form of <i>Violoncello</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
A Venetian 8' <i>regal</i> generally made of wood, the resonators
very small and similar to the Tromboncini; frequently the only
non-flue stop in a late 18th-cent. Venetian organ.  Boxwood often
the material, but the Serassi firm also made them with short
cylindrical pipes, resembling a small <i>Krummhorn</i> (Bastia, 1844).
</blockquote>
<p>
On the theatre organ, according to Strony, the <i>Violincello</i> is usually
a two-rank <a href="../c/Celeste.html">celeste</a> formed from 
<a href="Violin.html">Violin</a> pipes.  It varies greatly in
timbre and volume, and is found at 16', 8' and 4'.
