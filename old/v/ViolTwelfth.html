<blockquote>
A mild String stop of 2-2/3' on the manuals, and 5-1/3' on the pedals,
intended to furnish the third harmonic to the unison series in String
tone.  Both of these pitches in String tone are valuable.  They add
clarity and point to any <i>louder</i> flue combination, but it must
be remembered their harmonics duplicate none of those of the 
octave-sounding stops.  They are timbre creators and sources of
brightness in combination, but they will slightly thicken the tone
instead of making it luminous if added to any softer stops.  They
are String Organ <a href="../t/Twelfth.html">Twelfths</a> in String tone.
The average Swell Organ
could not tolerate such a stop, but an unusually large one could if the 
tone were mild, like that of an <a href="../e/EchoViol.html">Echo Viol</a>.
The scale is determined by the brightness and loudness desired.  Although
narrowing the scale makes a generally softer tone, it also makes it on
the brighter side, so a compromise must be reached in these two factors.
It should never take the listener's attention from the unison tone.
This is a stop that should not be overused, because it tires the ear 
and induces indifference to the music being played.  The hybrid
String-Diapasons are more useful than this stop, but are not so
suitable in a String division.
</blockquote>
<p>Irwin is incorrect.  The harmonics of a properly tuned 2-2/3' rank 
(not borrowed from an octave-sounding rank) will exactly duplicate
the harmonics of a open 8' rank.  Harmonics are integer multiples
of the fundamental frequency, and the frequency of a 2-2/3' is
already the 2nd harmonic of an open 8'.
