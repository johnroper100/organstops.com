<p>The most complete description we have of this stop comes from
Audsley, who says:</p>
<blockquote>
A percussion musical instrument recently introduced as a stop in
certain Organs.  Fine examples are made in this country by the
Kohler-Liebich Co., and by J.C. Deagan, both of Chicago.  The
Xylophone, made by the former firm, is constructed of four
octaves, chromatic, of Rosewood bars, graduated in size, and
adjusted over properly tuned cylindrical metal resonators.
The percussion action is electrically operated from the clavier
of an Organ in which the stop is placed.  Stops of this class
are not suited for the dignified Church Organ.
</blockquote>
<p>Irwin's and Sumner's descriptions are consistent with Audsley's,
but much less detailed.
This stop is found almost exlusively on theatre organs.
It often appears in two forms which share a common
mechanism: single strike, and repeating.
</p>
