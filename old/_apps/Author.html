If you're looking for impressive credentials, you won't find them here.
I began organ study around 1968 in Waterbury CT, and studied organ at Yale University,
where I received my Bachelor's degree -- in Computer Science, not organ.
I have been a member of the American Guild of Organists on and off (mostly on)
since 1980, and have served as a substitute organist as the opportunity arises 
and my schedule permits.
In the spring of 2003, while an unemployed victim of the Second Great Depression,
I was fortunate enough to serve a brief apprenticeship
as a voicer with Manual Rosales.
I am now living in southern New Hampshire.
</p><p>
I am also a folk musician (gasp!) -- yes, I even play
guitar -- performing with my wife 
<a href="http://www.mewsic.com" target="_top">Mary Ellen Wessels</a> as
�Hopeful Romantics�.  But the organ remains my first love,
particularly the works of Bach, Couperin and d'Aquin.
My hobbies, of which I have too many, include reading
(especially Science Fiction & Fantasy), model railroading
(N and G gauges), and woodworking.
