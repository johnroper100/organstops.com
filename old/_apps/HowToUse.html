<p>
Each entry file begins with a list of synonymous names.
Synonymous names share the same entry file; for example
<i>Cymbal</i> and <i>Zimbel</i> are described
on the same page, since they are two names for the same stop.
�Same stop� means that there are no significant differences
in the pitch, tone or construction implied by the different
names.
</p><p>
The language(s) of origin appears after each name, in one of the following variations:
</p>
<table border=1>
<tr><td>Language
	<td>The language of origin is known.
<tr><td>Language1 ?
	<td>The language of origin is suspected but not known for certain.
<tr><td>Language1, Language2
	<td>The name belongs to two (or more) languages.
<tr><td>Language1/Language2
	<td>The name is a hybrid of two languages.
<tr><td>(unknown)
	<td>The language of origin is unknown.
</table>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>
Every entry file has a section called �Examples�, except where
examples are cited in quotations and no other examples are known.
Each example has the following format:
</p>
<blockquote>
StopName pitch, division; location (church, etc.), city, state/province, country;
	builder year.
</blockquote>
<p>Where an example is cited as being the �earliest known� example,
this means the earliest example known to the author, based primarily
on the <a href="Bibliography.html#Osiris1">Osiris</a> archives.
If you know of an <i>earlier</i> example than the one claimed, 
<a href="InfoNeeded.html">please let me know.</a>
