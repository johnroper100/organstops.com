<p>
Each entry file begins with a list of synonymous stop names.
Synonymous names share the same entry file; for example
<i>Cymbal</i> and <i>Zimbel</i> are described
on the same page, since they are two names for the same stop.
�Same stop� means that there are no significant differences
in the pitch, tone or construction implied by the different
names.
</p><p>
If there are more than three entry names, the names are
arranged in two columns, unless the names are too
long to permit formatting in two columns.
If the number of names is odd, the left-hand column contains
one more entry than the right column.
All things being equal, the names are arranged in alphabetical
order, but the order may be modified to improve formatting.
</p><p>
The language of origin appears after each name.  If the language
is suspected but not certain, a question mark follows the language.
If the name belongs to more than one language, the languages are
listed separated by commas.  If the name is a combination of
languages, the languages are separated by forward slashes.
If the language is totally unknown, �(unknown)� appears in
place of the language name.
</p><p>
The more important or common names are listed first, formatted using 
the HTML tag <code>&lt;font size=+3&gt;&lt;b&gt;</code>.
The less important or less common names (if any) are listed second,
formatted using the HTML tag <code>&lt;font size=+2&gt;&lt;b&gt;</code>.
The language is in plain text.
The HTML tag <code>&nbsp;&lt;!--NAMES--&gt;&nbsp;</code>
must appear immediately before the first name, or immediately before the table
containing the names.
</p>

<h2>Information</h2>
<p>
Each entry file should contain the following information, if possible:
</p>
<ul>
<li>An English translation of each name, if it is not already English,
	and an etymology for each name.
<li>The tonal attributes of the stop.
<li>How the stop is constructed, including materials, shape, etc.
<li>A list of stops of similar construction (for interesting construction).
<li>Scale examples, including any pertinent measurements.
<li>Composition examples for compound stops (see below).
<li>A history of the stop.
<li>Its usage in registration and/or tonal design
<li>A list of tonal variants (echo, octave, contra, celeste, hybrids, etc.)
<li>A list of linguistic variants (e.g. Flute, Pfeife, etc.)
<li>Examples in actual organs (see below).
<li>Commentary, in which opinion should be clearly distinguished
	from fact.
</ul>

<h2>Composition</h2>
<p>
Mixtures should have a Composition section containing examples
of the mixture's composition.
Each rank in the mixture should be specified using interval
notation (e.g. �17�) rather than by speaking length (e.g. �1-3/5'�),
with the exception of non-breaking mixtures (i.e. cornets),
which may be specified either way.
Each composition example is formatted in a table so that
identically pitched ranks line up vertically,
and the sections of compass are arranged with the higher pitches on top.
For example:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td><b>Cymbal V</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>c2 to c4</td><td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>15</td><td>19</td><td>22</td></tr>
<tr><td>c1 to b1</td><td><td> </td><td> </td><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>15</td><td>19</td><td>22</td><td>26</td><td>29</td></tr>
<tr><td>C to B	</td><td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>12</td><td>15</td><td>19</td><td>22</td><td>26</td><td>29</td><td>33</td></tr>
<tr><td>CC to BB</td><td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td>  </td><td>15</td><td>19</td><td>22</td><td>26</td><td>29</td><td>33</td><td>36</td></tr>
</table>


<h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
<p>
All stop names should be hyperlinked to their entry files,
with the following exceptions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A given stop name is a hyperlink only the first time it appears
	in each paragraph.  Subsequent appearances within a paragraph
	are not hyperlinks.
<li>Stop names are not hyperlinks in the main headings at the top
	of the file.
<li>Stop names are not hyperlinks in the Bibliography or Examples section.
</ul>

<h2>Quotations</h2>
<p>
If a quotation is less than approximately two lines in length,
it appears in the running text, enclosed with double quotes.
For example: �this is an example of a short quotation�.
If a quotation is more than approximately two lines in length,
it appears as a separate section using the HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>
element.  For example:
</p>
<blockquote>
This is an example of a longer quotation that spans more than
two lines.  In all quotations, the originally typography is
maintained as much as possible.  The main exception to this rule is
that stopnames are rendered as hyperlinks, subject to the rules
for hyperlinks described above.
</blockquote>
<p>
All quotations should be credited in the Bibliography section,
described below.
</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p>Don't use them, period.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>
Every entry file has a section called �Examples�, except where
examples are cited in quotations and no other examples are known.
If no examples at all are known, the body of the section should
read as follows (but not in a blockquote):
</p>
<blockquote>
None known.
<a href="InfoNeeded.html">Contributions welcome.</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
If examples are known, then up to five examples should be given.
Each example should be enclosed in the HTML tag 
<code>&lt;p&nbsp;class=example&gt;</code>, and should have the
following format:
</p>
<blockquote>
StopName pitch, division; location (church, etc.), city, state/province, country;
	builder year.
</blockquote>

<h2>Pictures</h2>
<p>
All pictures must be cross-referenced on the main
<a href="Illustrations.html">Illustrations</a> page.
Each image file should be rendered at 75 dpi in a size
reasonable for inclusion on the entry page.  This
picture is a hyperlink to the same image rendered at 300 dpi.
All images should be GIF or JPEG format.  GIF is preferred
for line drawings; JPEG is preferred for photographs.
</p>

<h2>Bibliography</h2>
<p>
The final section of each entry file is a Bibliography.
Each source is a hyperlink to the master Bibliography page,
followed by entry names, chapter numbers, or page numbers,
as appropriate.
Multiple citations for a single source are separated by
semicolons.  Each source description ends with a period.
</p><p>
If a source is used only for a very few entries, it can
be listed in full in the entries' bibliographies, rather
than on the master Bibliography page.
</p>

<h2>Footer</h2>
<p>
Each file ends with a horizontal rule, followed by the HTML tag
<code>&nbsp;&lt;!--FOOTER--&gt;&nbsp;</code>
followed by a
hyperlinked copyright notice, the name of the file,
the date it was last updated, and links to the
encyclopedia's home page and full index.
</p><p>
If the entry was written by a guest author, it should
contain a separate copyright notice, appropriate to
the author, rather than the standard one.
</p>

<h2>Miscellany</h2>
<p>
Files which are neither normal entry files nor appendices must
contain the HTML tag <code>&nbsp;&lt;!--AUXFILE--&gt;&nbsp;</code>
somewhere in the file.
