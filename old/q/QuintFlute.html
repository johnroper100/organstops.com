This name has been used for three different stops, 
two of which are described elsewhere under the synonyms
<a href="Quintflote.html">Flute Quint</a> and
<a href="../n/NasardFlute.html">Nasard Flute</a>.
The third is described by Audsley:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A compound Quint Flute, 8 ft., has recently been introduced
by Mr. George W. Till, of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania, USA],
and inserted in the so-called Etherial Organ of the large
Concert instrument in the Wanamaker Store, in Philadelphia.
So far as our knowledge extends, this is the most noteworthy
dual stop of 8 ft. pitch ever construted; and one that could
only be inserted, under favorable conditions, in Concert-room
Organs of the first magnitude.  Its compound voice is of
considerable grandeur, its tonality surpassing in depth and
richness of color that of any other flute-toned stop known
to have been produced up to the present time (1920).
</p><p>
The principal rank is a <a href="../c/ClearFlute.html">Clear Flute</a>,
8 ft., formed of open wood pipes from CC to c4, to which are added
twelve open metal pipes for octave coupling.  The scale is large,
the C pipe measuring, internally, 8 inches in width by 10 1/2 
inches in depth.  The subordinate rank is a 
<a href="Quint.html">Quint</a>, 5-1/3 ft., formed of covered
wood pipes from CC to f#2 - 43 notes, and open metal pipes from
g2 to c5 - 30 notes, all yielding a normal tone.  The stop speaks
on wind of 25 inches pressure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Irwin also mentions this stop: 
�A truly compound <i>Quint Flute</i> may be heard in a few organs,
made from two ranks such as an 8' 
<a href="../h/HarmonicFlute.html">Harmonic Flute</a> and
an open metal 5-1/3' of softer tone.�
<p>Other compound stops designed by George W. Till include
<a href="../d/Duophone.html">Duophone</a>,
<a href="../n/NasardFlute.html">Nasard Fl&ucirc;te</a>,
<a href="../n/NasardGamba.html">Nasard Gamba</a>,
and <a href="../t/TierceFlute.html">Tierce Flute</a>.
