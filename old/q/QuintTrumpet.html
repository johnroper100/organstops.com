<blockquote>
A 5-1/3' manual Chorus Reed belonging to the 16' series of stops,
which speaks at the interval of a fifth above the keys struck.
It should be drawn with a heavy 16' Chorus Reed to keep from
unbalancing the tone.  In practical application it is not often
used without the big 8' and 4' Reeds in combination.  This is the
third harmonic of the 16' sub-octave series, and is typical of
only larger organs.  Its abscence from the 16' Reed choir would
probably be noticed by the trained ear, since the <i>third</i>
harmonic of any series of stop-pitches is important, and always
a source of a full and satisfying sound.  Certainly, if once 
heard under ideal conditions, the ear would crave for it again, 
particularly in certain forms of music.  It can be designed to be 
<a href="../c/Cornopean.html">Cornopean</a>-like or extremely
assertive, but is usually under the 16' Reed it serves in loudness.
In trying to assimilate it into the ensemble the organist should
realize that it creates from thirty to fifty harmonics from each
pipe, and is based on a fifth-sounding note.  It would not be
easy to assimilate when based on an octave-sounding note, but
the <i>Quinte</i> Trumpet is much more close-toned.  With the 8'
(and 5'), but without the 16' Reed, this stop may sound too
penetrating and brilliant.  It is livelier than the
<a href="../b/BombardeQuinte.html">Bombarde Quinte</a>, and
may or may not be of the same timbre as the Trumpet Quint.
An octave coupler and a mixture can intensify its effects.
Practically speaking, a reverberant auditorium, wise use by
the organist, the in-tuneness of the organ, and a staccato
touch can help it to be a success in the music.
