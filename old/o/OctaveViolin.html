Irwin lists <i>Violina</i> and <i>Violetta</i> as synonyms for
<i>Octave Violin</i>, a <a href="OrchViolin.html">Violin</a> stop at 4' pitch.
Audsley describes <i>Violina</i> as being similar to <i>Violetta</i>,
but does not differentiate them in any way.  While Audsley does not
equate <i>Violetta</i> with <i>Octave Violin</i>, he describes it as
a small scale open cylindrical imititave stop of medium strength,
which is consistent with an <i>Octave Violin</i>.
Grove lists <i>Violina</i> simply as a 4' string of medium scale,
found in English and American organs of the 19th century.
Locher equates it with <a href="../g/Geigen.html">Violin Diapason</a>.
Skinner has this to say:
</p>
<blockquote>
A most beautiful voice and one of the most difficult to give the
precise character to make it so, is the Swell 4' Violina.  This voice
complements the lighter tonalities of the Swell organ, as the 4'
<a href="Octave.html">Octave</a> does the
<a href="OpenDiapason.html">Diapasons</a>,
except that its more fragile texture and the stops with which it is
associated belong to sheer beauty of tone and not at all to the
more powerful dynamic field.  For some unknown reason, the 4' Violin
seems to be too loud or too stringy, or in some way not just right,
unless made of conical pipes and of precisely the right strength
and character.
</blockquote>
<p>
In <i>The Art of Organ-Building</i> Audsley describes <i>Violino</i>
as an <i>Octave Violin</i>.  In his stop dictionary, published later,
<i>Violino</i> is listed only as a synonym for <a href="OrchViolin.html">Violin</a>,
but his description for <i>Violina</i> (not listed in his earlier work)
is consistent, in detail, with his earlier description of <i>Violino</i>.
This suggests that Audsley was incorrect in equating <i>Violino</i> with
<i>Octave Violin</i>, something no other source does.
</p>
<p>
There are alternate meanings for the name 
<a href="../v/Violetta.html">Violetta</a>.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Osiris contains nearly 70 examples of <i>Violina</i>, all at 4' pitch;
six examples of <i>Violetta</i>, all at 4' except for one at 8' (see below);
and one example of <i>Octave Violin</i>.</p>

<p class=example>Octave Violin 4', String Organ II; Convention Hall,
	Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA; Midmer-Losh.</p>
<p class=example>Violetta 8' (treble), Espressivo; Nostra Signora della 
	Consolazione, Genova, Italy; Locatelli 1880.  (This is the oldest
	known example of this stop name, and the only one at 8', though as a 
	treble-only stop, it could be considered a 4' rank.)</p>
<p class=example>Violetta 4', Gallery-Choir, Echo; St. Patrick's Cathedral,
	New York City, New York, USA; Kilgen 1930.  (The two stops are independent).</p>
