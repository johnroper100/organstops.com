An 8' stop voiced to imitate the orchestral instrument of the same name.
(The ordinary <a href="Oboe.html">Oboe</a> is usually not imitative.)
This stop has been made in a number of forms, nearly always as a
reed, but sometimes as a flue.  
George Willis is credited with the invention of this stop, and
the form used by him is described by Audsley as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
The resonators are of an extremely slender inverted conical form,
devoid of bells, and having closed upper ends and long and narrow
slots adjoining them.  This form of resonator is shown in [the illustration
reproduced here], which is drawn from the Willis Orchestral Oboe in the
Organ in the Town Hall, Huddersfield.  The reeds or <i>&eacute;schalotes</i>
are of very small scale, and have their stopped ends formed at an acute
angle upward from the lower edge of their faces.  The tongues or
<i>languettes</i> are very narrow, of good substance, and finely curved,
as usual in all Willis reeds.
</blockquote> 
<p>Bonavia-Hunt describes two other reed forms:</p>
<blockquote>
One method is to utilise the normal oboe tube and bell, and considerably
reduce the scale of both.  The shallot is likewise reduced in scale,
with a mere saw-cut openint, the base being sloped backward.  This form of
shallot can be used in all three types here described, and is known as the
orchestral oboe shallot.  The scaling of the Walker orchestral oboe
(which is made according to this pattern) is as follows: CC (8ft.), 2 9/16
in. at the top of the bell, 1 1/16 in at the bottom; tenor C (4 ft.),
1 15/16 in. at the top of the bell, 3/4 in. at the bottom.  The bells
are half-capped, and have a small hole pierced about midway between the
top and the bottom of the bell.
<br><br>
The third variety is that advocated by the late Mr. J. M. Boustead,
who adopted it, as the result of many experiments, in his large chamber
organ at Westfield, Wimbledon Common, now removed and used as material
for two separate organs.  Mr. Boustead tookan ordinary oboe pipe and
cut the tube down to a third its length, making the middle C (2ft.)
pipe about 8in. long and the tenor C (4 ft.) pipe about 1ft. 4in. long.
The diameter of the tenor C pipe thus cut down would be about 5/8 in.
Aboce treble C (1 ft.), the third length becomes too short for practical
purposes and the pipes have to be made harmonic, - that is, two-thirds
the normal oboe length.  Adjustable caps are, of course, necessary for
regulation.
</blockquote>
<p>Skinner describes his own <i>Orchestral Oboe</i> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
This follows the physical and acoustical form of its namesake fairly
closely.  Its shallot is very slender and sharply beveled at its lower
extremity.  The openings are narrow and the tongues thin.  The resonators
are slender and capped.  While the open valves of the orchestral
instrument determine the pitch of their associated tube length, they
do not cancel the qualifying effect on the tone.  To parallel this
effect in the organ pipe, we cap the top ande cut the tuning slot well
below the cap.  This forms a pocket which contributes a sympathetic
glow or sweetness to an otherwise acid tone.
<br><br>
The orchestral instrument has a single tube for all the notes.  The
diameter of the tubes is therefore relatively larger for each note
in going up the scale, since it remains constant, while the length
becomes shorter.  This results in a gradual change in quality in going
up or down the scale.  In developing an equivalent voice for the 
organ, this progressive change in character must be provided.  The
scale of pipes is therefore modified in going from one end of the
group to the other, as is necessary in the development of all 
orchestral voices for the organ.

<h2>Labial (Flue) Oboes</h2>

<p>William E. Haskell invented a labial (flue) form of the
Orchestral Oboe, used in a number of organs built by Estey.
Audsley provides the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
The [drawings reproduced below] clearly show the form and construction
of the middle c1 pipe of this labial Oboe, 8 ft.  The body of the pipe
measures 7/8 inch square, internally, at is mouth line, and, while its
width remains the same, its depth is gradually reduced to 11/16 inch
at its open end, the reduction commencing at twelve inches above the
mouth and taking a curved form from that point in the front of the pipe,
as indicated in the section, 1.  The block is sunk 3/8 inch below the
lower lip of the mouth.  The mouth is inverted, and its lower lip is
sloped on the inside down to the block level and slightly rounded.
The upper lip is filed on the outside so as to produce a sharp edge
slightly back from the face of the pipe.  All these peculiarities
are accurately indicated in the Section.  The mouth is a fraction over
1/8 inch in height.  The cap is made sufficiently long to extend
about 1/8 inch above the upper lip of the mouth, and is cut away and
sloped on the outside so as to support the small cylindrical harmonic
bridge in position, as shown in the Section, 1, and Front View, 2.
The cap is hollowed on the inside, and is filed so as to produce a
amsll sharp-edged wind-way, just sufficient to admit the passage of
a strip of a playing-card.  The cap is not nicked.  The under lip
of the mouth has twenty-seven straight and cleanly-cut nicks, as
depicted in Diagram 3, which shows the mouth and lower part of the
pipe with the cap removed.  The illustrations are so accurately
drawn to scale that further description of the sound-producing
portion of the pipe is unnecessary.  The pipe is tuned in the usual
way by a metal shade at top.  The stop is voiced on wind of 3 1/2
inches, the pipes requiring a very small supply.
