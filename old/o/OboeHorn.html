<p>
The <i>Oboe Horn</i> was invented by Robert Hope-Jones.  
It is most often described as a cross between the
<a href="Oboe.html">Oboe</a> and the <a href="../f/FrenchHorn.html">Horn</a>,
though Sumner describes it as a hybrid of an Oboe and a close-toned
<a href="../t/Trumpet.html">Trumpet</a>.
In construction it resembles a large-scale unimitative Oboe; Wedgwood says that it had
weighted tongues, and Irwin describes its resonators as having two inverted conical
sections, the upper being of wider flare than the lower, sometimes capped & slotted.
Norman & Beard occasionally made this stop under the name <i>Cor-Oboe</i>.
It is found at 16' and 8' pitch.
Regarding the theatre organ stop, Strony writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
This theatre organ voice is very similar to the standard
<a href="Oboe.html">Oboe</a> that has appeared in church organs
for many years.  Its use in a theatre organ is twofold: most importantly,
it is an accompaniment stop; and secondly, it is a delicate, but dark
solo voice.  
<br>
Many theatre organs of 15 ranks or more included this stop.
All builders made it and most examples are very similar.  However, some
Barton organs had an Oboe Horn that was much different.  It was much
louder and fuller - more of a chorus reed than an accompaniment stop.
<br>
Normally, it appears only at 8' pitch, but some instruments have a
16' Oboe Horn.
