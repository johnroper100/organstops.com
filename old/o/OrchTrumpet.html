<p>Irwin lists <i>Orchestral Trumpet</i> as a synonym for
<i>Brass Trumpet</i> with the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
A very brilliant and penetrating Chorus Reed stop of fiery
and free-toned brass color and 8' manual pitch.  It has almost
twice the number of partials as its orchestral counterpart,
and a louder sound.  Some examples are of only moderate power
and quite light in tone, depending upon the other stops in 
the organ.  This Trumpet has the maximum of clang-tone and
number of upper partials, as well as the exponentially
shaped resonators of solid brass to project them into space.
These resonators are also well polished and do not absorb
the great number of very soft, high-pitched components the
inverted-conical pipes of the <a href="../t/Trumpet.html">Trompette</a>
do.  Therefore, these high but soft partials are allowed to
escape the pieps and are more likely to reach the ears of the
listener.  It is the most brilliant but not the loudest Reed
in the organ.  Many examples are still playing throughout
the country, and most are known as <i>Gottfried Trumpets</i>
in honor of Anton Gottfried, who built many of these stops.
</blockquote>
<p>
Audsley implies that the <i>Orchestral Trumpet</i> is not
a chorus reed, and describes its tone as
�singularly bright, silvery, and jubilant�, and specifying
that it be voiced �to imitate as closely as possible the
characteristic tones of the orchestral instrument.�
</p>
<p>
Grove describes <i>Feldtrompete</i> as �the German imitative trumpet,
not <i>en chamade</i> as in Spain but often held in the case
vertically; others were interior trumpets, all of a thin, strong tone.�
Grove claims that <a href="../f/Feldflote.html">Feldpfeife</a>
is also a synonym, but we believe this to be sloppy copy-editing.  
<i>Feldtrompete</i> may also be a synonym for
<a href="../m/MilitaryTrumpet.html">Field Trumpet</a>.
</p>
The <a href="../b/BrassTrumpet.html">Brass Trumpet</a>
of the theatre organ is a different stop.
