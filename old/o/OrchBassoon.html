<p>An imitative reed stop of 8' or 16' pitch.
It is sometimes given the name <a href="../f/Fagotto.html">Bassoon</a>
or its synonyms, though those names often refer to an unimitative chorus reed.
Audsley lists this stop with the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
The name properly given to the lingual stop, of 8 ft. pitch,
the tones of which successfully imitate those of the orchestral
Bassoon.  The pipes of the most satisfactory examples of the
stop have resonators of wood or metal, conical or pyramidal
in form and of very small scale.  The true compass of the
Bassoon of the orchestra does not extend beyond Eb1; 
accordingly, above this note the stop is completed in what
are practically <a href="OrchOboe.html">Orchestral Oboe</a>
pipes.  The tone of the Orchestral Bassoon should throughout
its compass be of greater body than that which characterizes
the Orchestral Oboe, so as to give a marked individuality
to the stop.
</blockquote>
<p>Irwin describes it as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
An imitative Reed of 16' or 8' on the manuals, 16' on the pedals,
voiced with the delicate, pungent, reedy timbre of the instrument.
It is brighter in most specimens than the stop named 
<a href="../f/Fagotto.html"><i>Fagotto</i></a> (<i>Orchestral Fagotto</i>
has been seen), and on modern organs this usually means that the
resonators are slightly smaller-scaled in the Orchestral Bassoon.
This is one of the better imitations on the organ, sounding with
much of the characteristic lightness, but the soft clatter of the
spurious harmonics that come from the cane reed is lost to the
organ pipe, and also to the <a href="OrchOboe.html">Orchestral Oboe</a>.
The brass reed is actually less likely to give a quantity of inharmonics
than the real instrument.  This is a solo and ensemble stop.
Its extremely slender resonators are unison in length, and inverted-conical.
They are capped, with a long, slender slot near the top of each pipe
for the emission of the sound wave.
