A prefix Listed only by Wedgwood, who says:
<blockquote>
<b>Melodic</b> - <i>e.g.,</i> Melodic Flute, Melodic Diapason, Melodic Viol.<br>
A prefix signifying that the stop so described speaks on a �Melody Attachment�.
The latter is a device, the operation of which silences all the notes of the
chord played on the particular manual or stop to which it is attached, with
the exception of the treble one.  In its inversion it may be employed to
silence all except the bass note of a stop or stops, and thus render possible
pedal bass effects from a manual.  The melody attachment, as applied to the
harmonium, was invented by Dawes, and patented by him under the name of
Soprano Coupler in 1864.  The reverse effect, the double bass coupler, was
patented by Dawes & Ramsden in 1868.  Similar contrivances were applied to
the harmonium by Howard, and Mason & Hamlin.  The Melodic Coupler was first
adapted to the organ by Mr. Thomas Casson, whose �Positive� organs (of the
larger pattern) normally possess a double bass stop acting from the lowest
note struck, and also a melodic stop reinforcing the treble note.
<br> . . .<br>
Attached to large instruments it may be seen at: London Organ School;
Cathcart House, South Kensington, W. (Positive Organ Co.); St. Paul,
Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen), (Stahlhuth).  Mr. R. S. Rutt, of Leyton, has
also patented an ingenious �part-singing� soundboard, by means of which
it is possible to isolate or combine together any of the individual
parts of four-part harmony on the given stop or manual to which it is
applied.  A somewhat similar contrivance has also been designed by Mr.
Casson.  The Double Touch is another device, admitting of the accentuation
of isolated notes.
