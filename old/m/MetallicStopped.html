<blockquote>
The organ built by Schulze for the 1851 Exposition was remarkable for
the exquisite quality of its <a href="../g/Gedeckt.html">Gedeckt</a>
stops.  It is traditionally reported that the pipes of this instrument
were not open to public examination.  Bishop, the celebrated organ
builder, was so impressed with the tone of these Gedeckts that he
endeavored, after careful listening, to imitate it.  By dint of much
experimenting he succeeded to his satisfaction in doing so.  He
employed wooden pipes of the ordinary rectangular shape outside, but,
above middle C, internally of cylindrical form.  When, sometime later,
Messrs. Bishop had Schulze's organ through their hands, it was found
that the Stopped Metallic was really a very faithful representation
of the original Gedeckt tone.  Shortly after Bishop's attempt, Schulze
enlarged the organ at the Temple Church, London, and in the most 
liberal manner he permitted other builders to examine his pipes.  
It was then discovered that his 
<a href="../l/LieblichGedeckt.html">Lieblich Gedeckt</a>,
the nearest equivalent to which had hitherto in England been made of
wood, was of metal.  As it was then found easier to employ metal pipes,
the use of the Stopped Metallic was discontinued.  
The <a href="MetallicFlute.html">Metallic Flute</a>
was a stop, generally of open pipes, voiced on similar lines.
<br> . . .<br>
The author well remembers a Stopped Metallic of beautifully mellow
tone at Brighton College (Bishop).  Other examples were inserted at
Brompton Oratory, Bombay Cathedral, etc. (Bishop).
