<p>
A pedal reed stop of the <a href="../r/Regal.html">Regal</a> class, 
found at 512' pitch.
As is typical of regals, the resonators are
1/16 length, the longest being 32' long.
The cost of the resonators was one factor in this stop's ultimate failure.
While little information is available,
it is believed to have been an early form of <a href="../d/Diaphone.html">Diaphone</a>.
</p><p>
With the frequency of this stop ranging from 1hz (one cycle (thump) per second)
in the bass to 6 hz in the so-called treble, it functions very well as a
metronome.
</p><p>
The stop, along with the entire organ and the church in which it resided,
was lost when two of this stop's notes ciphered simultaneously.
By a tragic coincidence, the resultant tones were at exactly the
resonant frequencies of the sanctuary, which caused the sound to be
amplified to the point where the building collapsed.

<h2>Bibliography</h2>
<p>
<font size=-1>In the interest of maintaining the veracity of other entries in this work,
a few of which are only slightly more believable than this one,
(see <a href="../f/Fuchsschwanz.html">Fuchsschwanz</a>),
the author feels compelled to admit that this entry is, indeed,
a complete and total fabrication.
However, Osiris lists a specification for the organ of St. Fridolins, 
Muenster, Bad Saeckingen, Germany which contains a pedal stop named
<i>Vox Balaenae</i>, a 64' resultant playing only on low C.</font>
