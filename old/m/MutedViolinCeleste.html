<blockquote>
An 8' undulating stop on the manuals, formed from two, preferably three, 
ranks of <a href="MutedViol.html">Muted Violin</a> pipes.  If two, 
they are <i>normal-sharp, normal-flat,</i> or <i>sharp-flat</i> in 
pitches, the last pattern denying the organist a single rank for 
combination.  The <i>normal-sharp-very sharp</i> pattern reproduces 
the orchestral effect very realistically.  These ranks need not be 
more than one or two beats per second from the normal pitch, and 
will not therefore sound too sharp in combinations.  An additional 
three-rank <a href="../c/Celeste.html">c&eacute;leste</a> 
made from this same stop and tuned to be <i>normal-flat-very flat</i>, 
if added to the three-rank sharp c&eacute;leste above, would create 
the most realistic orchestral effect possible, and it is from these 
<i>muted</i> pipes that one of the most realistic String sounds 
comes, since the ear remembers the violins of the orchestra most 
ideally as soft.  This soft c&eacute;leste, whether two, three, or 
six ranks, is usually found only in the String Organ, since it 
gives out too much dissonance, even though quite pleasant to the 
ear, to combine well with other divisions.<br>
 . . .<br>
The muted violins of the organ appeal to some organists as the most 
usable of the stops of this family of tone.  The intense 
<a href="../o/OrchViolin.html">Viole d'Orchestre</a>, although it 
can be given any timbre, acuteness, loudness, or pitch desired, mixes 
best with other String stops.  The String stops of the church organ 
must be able to blend with many other stops.  This excludes the most 
small-scaled and incisive, but not necessarily the imitative, muted, 
or otherwise.  The Muted Violin C&eacute;leste is formed from an 
alloy high in tin content, of quite small scale, and very low mouth 
cut-up.
