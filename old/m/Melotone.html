This stop was brought to my attention by Christopher Thompson, who wrote:
<blockquote>
Exclusively used by the John Compton Organ 
Company, London, England after 1935.  It was a patent of this firm and until
the last few years was never found outside the UK.  This was available at 8,
4, 2-2/3 and 2 pitches.  At first it was labelled "Melophone" but the name
was soon changed to "Melotone" for the main solo voices at the mentioned 
pitches.  The sound was produced not by pipes but by an early means of 
electronic tone production using an electrostatic method.  These stops were
used exclusively on the Solo manual on theatre organs although 3 melotone 
units were installed to classical instruments.  The sound could be described
as quite eccentric and was a cross between a Wurlitzer 
<a href="../t/Tibia.html">Tibia</a> and 
<a href="../c/Clarinet.html">Clarinet</a> with a slight echo.  
The melotone produced other sounds such as 
<a href="Musette.html">Musette</a>, 
<a href="../e/EnglishHorn.html">Cor Anglais</a>, 
<a href="../k/Krummhorn.html">Krumhorn</a>, 
<a href="../c/Chimes.html">Chimes</a>, 
<a href="../c/Chimes.html">Carillon,</a>
<a href="../v/Vibraphone.html">Vibraphone</a> and 
<a href="Marimba.html">Marimba</a>.
These different sounds could be created using "additive synthetic mixing" and 
different degrees of echo.  The melotone could be straight or had its own
vibrato.  Towards the end of the 1930s and after World War II up until the 
demise of the firm in 1969, the melotone unit was improved in sound and 
developed into a complete electronic organ.  The melotone's popularity was
very extreme in that organists either loved it or hated it with some 
describing it as a "sick cow" effect.  However, when blended with a Tibia or
Flute Chorus chorus and used in slow ballad pieces it could produce a very
beautiful sound.  The love/hate relationship with the melotone caused much
controversy amongst theatre organ enthusiasts and continues to this day.
