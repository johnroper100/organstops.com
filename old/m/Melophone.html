<p>Wedgwood lists this stop with the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
(1) A string-toned stop of very delicate intonation.  Bridlington Priory
Church (Anneessens, of Belgium).  (2) A specialty of the Kimball Organ
Co., consisting of a metal cylindrical flue pipe, of 
<a href="../g/Geigen.html">Violin Diapason</a> scale,
speaking two qualities of unison pitch at one and the same time,
viz., String and �<a href="../o/OpenWood.html">Open Wood</a>.�
In other words a string-toned Flute.  Washington Temple, U.S.A.
(Kimball Co.).
</blockquote>
<p>Maclean describes Kimball's <i>Melophone</i> as a large scale
stop of the <a href="Melodia.html">Melodia</a> type.
Irwin gives a different description:</p>
<blockquote>
A Flute stop of solo quality, at 8' on the manuals, and formed
from heavy-walled open metal pipes, sometimes wood.  It is quite
loud, and sounds as a hybrid between the horn's overtones and
an open Flute.  Good examples are sympathetic and warm in quality.
A few are string-like or even bright.  It is also a big-toned
ensembled stop, of easy blend with Trumpets or Diapasons.
It has a complete train of harmonics since its pipes are 
inverted-conical and the mouth cut-up is fairly low.  It may
be heard from the Solo chests of concert or theater organs,
and also some church organs.  A few examples have belled tops
for one-third to one-half their lengths.  The wooden ranks
are slightly inverted-pyramidal in shape.
</blockquote>
<p>
This stop should not be confused with the
<a href="Mellophone.html">Mellophone</a>, a reed stop.
