<p>Audsley lists <i>Harmonic Clarion</i> and <i>Clairon Harmonique</i>
with the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
This lingual stop is the true Octave of the
<a href="HarmonicTrumpet.html">Harmonic Trumpet</a>, 8 ft.,
and is, accordingly, of 4 ft. pitch.  The pipes are formed
in all respects similar to those of the unison stop, being
of about double the normal speaking lengths, voiced on
high-pressure wind to speak the octave pitch.  The
Clairon Harmonique was invented by Aristide Cavaill&eacute;-Coll,
and introduced for the first time in the R&eacute;cit-Echo
Expressif of the Organ in the Royal Church, Saint-Denis,
constructed in 1841.
</blockquote>
<p>The St.-Denis organ apparently still includes a <i>Clairon
Harmonique</i> in the R&eacute;cit.  Even if it is the original
one, it is not clear how it has survived over a century and
a half of rebuilds and restorations.  
<a href="../_apps/InfoNeeded.html">Contributions welcome.</a></p>
<p>Irwin lists all three synonyms with the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
An octave Chorus Reed of 4' on the manuals, and 8' on the
pedals, voiced to yield an unusually powerful and assertive
treble <a href="../t/Trumpet.html">Trumpet</a> tone of the
free type rather than the firmer <a href="../t/Tuba.html">Tuba</a>
type.  Making the resonators of all the pipes of this Trumpet
double (or triple) length does not make the tone more brilliant
in so far as the <i>number</i> of partials is concerned, 
although it may sound more briliant because there are stronger
partials nearer the fundamental's pitch.  Harmonic-length
reed pipes wipe out the very high-pitched (perhaps dissonant)
partials, which helps to make a better Chorus Reed ensemble.
They also increase the total power of the pipe.  Both of these
factors are advantages in the loud treble Reed, and 
<i>harmonic</i> pipes are usually included at the high pitches
even though the name does not appear on the drawknob.  Weight
of tone and better blend with the big flue stops is also
achieved.  However, the type of tone in the harmonic reed
pipe is at least theoretically straying away from the
<i>fanfare</i> sound now and going towards the Tuba sound,
which is an ensemble as well as a solo sound.
</blockquote>
<p>
Strony gives <i>Harmonic Clarion</i> as a synonym for
<a href="../c/ClarionHorn.html">Clarion Horn</a>.
