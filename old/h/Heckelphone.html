<p>Skinner describes this rare stop as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
A close-knit pungent and highly individual orchestral reed of
16' and 8' pitches, developed by the author.  It resembles the
<a href="../e/EnglishHorn.html">English Horn</a> but has more power.
The Heckelphone is related to the English Horn about as the
<a href="../d/DoubleClarinet.html">Bass Clarinet</a> is related
to the <a href="../c/Clarinet.html">Clarinet</a>.
It is difficult to realize that so marked a difference in 
character between the English Horn and the Heckelphone is due
to so slight a difference in scale.
One of the finest examples of this stop is to be found at Hill
Auditorium, the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where it appears
at both 16' and 8' pitches.
</blockquote>

<p>Irwin, the only other source to list it, has this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
An imitative Reed of 8' on the manuals, having a round and deep timbre 
somewhat like the color of the <a href="../e/EnglishHorn.html">English Horn</a>
stop, but this �Baritone Oboe� is of stronger volume and greater individuality.
Since it is quite rare as an organ stop, its position is usually in the Solos
of very large instruments.  The medium-large resonators are shaped as two
inverted-conical sections: a very narrow one, two-thirds the unison length,
is at the bottom; one of wider flare, completing the unison length, sits on
the top and is capped, with a slot near the top for the emission of the
sound.  The top diameter is not of unusually wide scale, but just a little 
wider than the <a href="../f/Fagotto.html">Fagotto</a>.  The brass reeds
are tuned by spring-like wires, the pipes by rolls of metal in the slots.
</blockquote>

<p>The stop is named after the orchestral instrument,
a member of the oboe family with a wide bore, invented around 1904.
Its range descends to A below 8' C.
