<p>Audsley lists <i>Harmonic Tuba</i> in his
<i>Organ Stops and their Artistic Registration</i>
with the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
The most powerful lingual stop, of 8 ft. pitch, inserted in the Organ.
Its pipes are of large scale, having resonators of inverted conical
shape and double the normal standard length.  The reeds are formed
similar to, but slightly larger in scale than, those of the
<a href="HarmonicTrumpet.html">Harmonic Trumpet</a>.  The stop
is voiced on wind of fifteen inches upward, according to the volume
and power of the tone required.  Reeds with double tongues have
been suggested for this impressive stop; but they are too troublesome
to make, too uncertain in speech, and too difficult to tune, ever
to favor their adoption: and it is questionable if they are
desirable; for sufficient musical noise can be produced by the
single-tongued reeds for all legitimate effects in dignified music.
<br>
The proper tone of the Harmonic Tuba is full, sonorous, and
commanding; dominating all the voices of the 8 ft. stops, labial
and lingual, in the Organ.  Its use is, accordingly, limited to
rare and very special effects, chiefly of an orchestral character,
and to grand climaxes in which a �full organ� burst of sound is
called for.
</blockquote>
<p>In <i>The Art of Organ-Building</i>, written a decade and a
half earlier, Audsley states that
this stop is voiced on at least 20" of wind, and that the
reeds should have double tongues.  He evidently changed his mind
on these points.
</p>
<p>Irwin lists both names with the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
A very loud Chorus Reed of 8' manual pitch, like the
<a href="HarmonicTrumpet.html">Harmonic Trumpet</a>,
furnished with double (or triple) resonators whose added
length is designed to remove from the tone many of the
very high partials that characterize these two Chorus Reeds
when of normal unison length.  The harmonic length, usually
not in the bass octave, enables these pipes to maintain an even
and steady pitch of both fundamental and most overtones, at
least the lower-pitched ones.  This is generally a louder Reed
than the Harmonic Trumpet, and also one of heavier and firmer
tone.  Some of the freedom of vibration the listener can hear
in the Harmonic Trumpet is not in this tone.  In many specimens
it is completely free from dissonance, at least of the noticeable
sort, because of the damping action of the longer tubes.  These
tubes ... are thick-walled to prevent their own absorption of
the reeds' tones.  In both of these harmonic Reeds they are of
spotted metal for their full lengths.  Ordinary pipe metal of
high lead content would never resonate the highest overtones.
Tin in the proportion of from 35% to 85% is needed in these
Reeds, and in most other Reeds, because it permits the voicer
to obtain a brighter tone with a resonator of average dimensions.
These resonators are tuned by rolling the metal in the slot.
<br>
This Tuba is not so bright as the 
<a href="../t/TubaMirabilis.html">Tuba Mirabilis</a> or the
<a href="../t/TubaMirabilis.html">Tuba Magna</a>, but is much
brighter than the <a href="../t/TubaSonora.html">Tuba Sonora</a>.
Like the Harmonic Trumpet, it is a solo and ensemble stop of
great power and excellent blend with flues as well as other
Reeds.
</blockquote>
<p>
The name <i>Harmonic Tuba</i> has also been used as a synonym
for <a href="../t/TubaHorn.html">Tuba Horn</a>.
Other candidates for the loudest organ stop include
