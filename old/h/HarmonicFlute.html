The principle of the harmonic pipe &mdash; making the pipe twice its normal length
and then overblowing it to speak the octave &mdash; has been known at least since
the early 17th century.  It was used infrequently until Cavaill&eacute;-Coll invented
the <i>Fl&ucirc;te Harmonique</i>, an open metal harmonic flute stop first used in
1841 in the Church of Saint-Denis near Paris, France.  Cavaille&eacute;-Coll placed
seven harmnic flute stops in that instrument, using the names 
<a href="../f/FluteTraversiereHarmonique.html">Fl&ucirc;te Traversi&eacute;re Harmonique</a>,
<a href="../f/FluteOctavianteHarmonique.html">Fl&ucirc;te Octaviante Harmonique</a> and
<a href="../f/FluteOctavinHarmonique.html">Fl&ucirc;te Octavin Harmonique</a>, as well as
<i>Fl&ucirc;te Harmonique</i>.  It soon became popular in both France and England.
While Audsley claims that Cavaille&eacute;-Coll was the first to use harmonic
metal pipes, they were well known to Praetorius.
</p>
<p>
The tone of this stop varies a good deal across different examples: it may be loud or
soft, dull or bright.  Unlike its close relative the
<a href="../o/OrchFlute.html">Orchestral Flute</a>, it is not necessarily imitative.
While Hopkins &amp; Rimbault, Skinner and Maclean speak of its good blending qualities,
Wedgwood states that it can muddy the tone of the Diapasons, and Sumner warns that
"care must be taken to prevent it from disturbing the purity of the diapason chorus".
</p>
<p>
Harmonic flutes are constructed from open pipes which are twice the normal speaking
length.  The pipes are overblown to speak their first harmonic (the octave).  A hole
is pierced in each pipe to prevent the formation of an acoustical
node at the center of the pipe.  Authorities differ as to the exact placement
of this hole: 2/5 the length of the pipe from the languid, 7/16 of that distance
(Bonavia-Hunt), in the center (Grove), or "anywhere in the middle portion" (Wedgwood).
This harmonic construction is used only in the treble portion of the stop, with the
lowest pipe being anywhere from tenor G to C above middle C for an 8' stop.
Below that, large-scale open pipes of normal length are used.  The 8' octave
is often comprised of stopped pipes.  A common scale for the harmonic pipes is
3" in diameter at middle C.  Bonavia-Hunt specifies wind pressures from 8" to
an extreme of 15".  Wedgwood states that the upper and lower lips are sometimes
leathered, and that the pipes are sometimes given long ears for the purpose of
tuning.
</p>

<p>Audsley provides the following description and accompanying illustration
of a metal Harmonic Flute:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In selecting a stop for illustration and description we cannot do better than take
the Fl&ucirc;te Harmonique, 8 ft., in the Great division of the Concert-room Organ
erected by Cavaill&eacute;-Coll in the Town Hall of Manchester [England].  The
lowest harmonic pipe of this stop is g1, shown in correct proportions in the
accompanying illustration. The pipe is 2.37 inches indiameter and 29 1/2 inches in
length from its mouth-line.  At the distance of 13 inches from that line a hole
1/8 inch in diameter is drilled, as shown in the illustration.  The mouth of the
pipe is 1 3/4 inches in width and 11/16 inch in height, having a straight upper
lip.
The bass of the [stop] is formed of open wood pipes, the CC one of which has the
scale of 5.00 inches by 6.50 inches.  The open metal, non-harmonic pipe &mdash;
middle c1 &mdash; has a diameter of 2.75 inches and a speaking length of 22 inches,
belonging to a very large scale.
</p><p>
Certain organ builders prefer to construct the Harmonic Flute entirely of metal.
MM. Casavant Fr&egrave;res, of St. Hyacinthe, P.Q., Canada, have furnished the
following particulars.  The pipes of the Harmonic Flute, 8 ft., are open and
non-harmonic from CC to e1 = 29 notes; and the larger of these, when circumstances
permit, are advantageously employed as displayed pipes.  The CC pipe is 5.37
inches in diameter internally, having a mouth one-fourth the circumference of the
pipe, and slightly more than one-fourth its width in height, having a straight
upper lip.  The tenor C pipe is 3.26 inches in diameter, having a mouth of the
proportions just given.  The diameters are approximately in the ratio 1:2.66.
The harmonic pipes commence on f1.  This pipe is 2.03 inches in diamater and,
of course, about twice the ordinary speaking length.  It is pierce with a hole
about 1/16 inch in diameter.  The general rule for determining the position of
this hole in harmonic pipes is as follows: Divide the body of the pipe &mdash;
the full length of which is calculated to yield the note an octave below that
which it is destined to yield when rendered harmonic &mdash; into nine equal 
parts, and make the performation at the height of four of these parts above
the languid.  The size of the hole should be carefully graduated; and their
size varies in different stops according to the strength and quality of the
tone desired.  As MM. Casavant correctly state, a larger hole than that above
named changes the tone somewhat and permits its strength to be increased.  The
mouths of the harmonic pipes are one-fourth the circumference of their 
respective pipes, and one-third of their respective widths in height.  The
nicking of their languids and lower lips is preferably made deep, about 
eighteen nicks being made in the c2 pipe, and in the others in proportion.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regarding the wooden form of the stop, Audsley writes:</p>
<blockquote>
In the unison stop, the bass octave is generally of 
<a href="../l/Lieblichgedeckt.html">Lieblichgedeckt</a> pipes; the seventeen
pipes from C to e1, inclusive, are of open unison lengths; and from f1 to c4,
inclusive, the pipes are harmonic, and, accordingly, of double lengths.  In
the octave stop, from c#3 to c4 the pipes are harmonic and made of metal.
The scale of the lowest open non-harmonic pipe is 2 1/4 inches in width by 
2 3/4 inches in depth; and that of the highest non-harmonic pipe is 1 3/16
inches in width by 1 7/16 inches in depth.  The lowest harmonic pipe, made
double length, is 1 1/4 inches in width by 1 1/2 inches in depth; and the
highest harmonic pipe of wood is 3/8 inch in width by 15/32 inch in depth.
The mouths of all the pipes are inverted, are of the full widths of the scale,
and are one-third of their width in height.  Their caps are of the ordinary
hollowed-out form and are depressed slightly below the lower lips of the
mouths.

On the theatre organ, Strony tells us that the <i>Harmonic Flute</i> is an orchestral flute 
found only in larger instruments, usually at 4' and 2' pitch.  Wurlitzer's examples
have little in common with the French <i>Fl&ucirc;te Harmonique</i>, being more like
an <a href="../o/OrchFlute.html">Orchestral Flute</a>.
</p>

There are alternate meanings for the names
<a href="../f/FluteOctaviante.html">Fl&ucirc;te Octaviante</a>
and <a href="Harmonieflote.html">Harmoniefl&ouml;te</a>.
