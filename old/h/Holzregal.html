<p>Listed only by Irwin, who says:</p>
<blockquote>
A short-resonatored Reed stop of 16', 8', or 4' on either manuals or 
pedals.  Since its pipes are made from <i>wood</i>, it is less brilliant 
than the other <a href="../r/Regal.html">Regals</a>.  It is brighter in 
timbre, however, than the <a href="Holzrankett.html">Holzrankett</a>, 
and even more likely to be droning, acid, pointed in brightness, or 
highly individualistic in some way in quality.  Even these wooden pipes 
may be brilliant, but this variety of Regal mostly sounds with one of 
the softer tones of this group of stops.  Since the metallic and 
scintillating effects of the metal resonators are not possible to it, 
there remains in most examples the audible piping and windy sound obvious 
in all of the Ranketts, Regals, and <a href="../k/Kinura.html">Kinuras</a>. 
Its functions are to create individuality in some line of notes, usually 
with a soft flue, and occasionaly to build up a bright tone.  It is, like 
all short-resonator Reeds, very much the artistic product of its voicer.
