<p>Listed only by Irwin, who says:</p>
<blockquote>
A form of <a href="../r/Rankett.html">Rankett</a> with <i>wooden</i> 
resonators of short length, speaking at 8' or 4' on both manuals and 
pedals.  It is much less bright and more muffled in tone than the 
usual metal form.  But it has the sibilant, reedy, covered tone of 
the metal resonators.  A few specimens also have a peculiar droning 
sound.  The flood of higher partials that comes from its thin reeds 
resembles those of many <a href="../r/Regal.html">Regals</a> in effect, 
but Regals are more likely to be metallic and there is none of the 
brilliant whine in this stop.  Neither does it have the nasality of the 
<a href="../o/Oboe.html">Oboe</a> or the piercing, small tone of 
the <a href="../m/Musette.html">Musette</a>.  Upon hearing it, perhaps 
as a pedal line of notes in the polyphonic style, the listener is 
immediately alerted to the fact that its timbre is unique; it stands 
out, but, interestingly enough, it is not loud.  The manual and pedal 
ranks are both usable alone or as adjuncts to the flues.
