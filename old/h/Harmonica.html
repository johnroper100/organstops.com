A small-scaled flute/string hybrid of 8' pitch, having a soft, bright tone.
It is usually made of wood, bearded (according to Wedgwood),
and sometimes slightly pyramidal (according to Audsley).
Maclean considers it to be virtually an Echo
<a href="../v/Violone.html">Violone</a>.
Audsley provides the illustration reproduced here, with the following
description:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="Harmonica.gif"><img src="Harmonica$.gif" align=right></a>
Some German organ-builders use scales which give the pipes of the
Harmonica a greater depth than width.  An example of this treatment
obtains in the fine stop in the [Church of St. Bartholomew] Armley 
[England] Organ, in which the pipes from middle c1 to the top note are
about twice their width in depth.  Schulze seems to have found this
extreme proportion favorable to the production of very soft and refined
qualities of tone.  The chief peculiarity of the Harmonica pipe is the
formation of its mouth and attendant cap, shown in the accompanying
illustration, which presents a Front View and Sections of the mouth
portion of the c1 pipe of the Armley stop.  It will be seen that the
mouth is circular, hollowed on the inside of the pipe so as to present
a thin lip to the wind-stream.  The manner in which this is done is 
shown in the Sections 2 and 3.  The size of the circular mouth varies
according to the quality and strength of the tone desired, but it
should not be less than one-half the internal width of the pipe.
It will be observed in Section 2 that the cap is compound, being
formed of an inner, wedge-shaped piece, which forms the lower lip of
the mouth; and in outer piece, in which the wind-way is carefully cut
in the manner shown, in block, in the Transverse Section of the mouth, 3.
In the formation of the compound caps extreme care and accuracy must be
observed in graduating the thickness and slope of the wedge-piece, and
smoothly rounding and polishing with black-lead its upper edge or lip.
The chief difficulty in connection with the voicing of this beautiful
stop lies in the adjustment of both parts of the caps with relation to
the circular mouths, and the exact proportions of the wind-ways, so as
to obtain a perfectly even intonation throughout the compass.  As a
rule, the cap is adjusted to cover about one-third of the diameter of
the mouth, but different positions are adopted according to the tonality
desired.  While pine may be used for the sides and backs of the pipes,
it is necessary, with such a form of mouth, for their fronts and caps
to be of some close-grained hard wood: preferably beech for the caps.

Audsley specifies wind pressure of 1 1/2" to 2 1/2", and provides
two scales, both for square pipes, one used by Haas, a German 
organ-builder, the other recommended by Audsley himself, the
latter having a ratio of 1:2.66 (halving on the 18th pipe):

According to Grove it was used by some 19th century builders for
various soft stops, including a free reed.
Skinner supports the idea of <i>Harmonica</i> as a free reed,
considering it to be more or less synonymous
with <a href="../p/Physharmonika.html">Physharmonika</a>.
Williams dates the name from as early as 1781.
No examples of this reed form are known.
