A variety of <a href="../o/OpenDiapason.html">Diapason</a> with a horn-like tone,
resulting from the pipes being slotted.
While the organ builder Walker & Sons of London, England apparently favored
this stop, as did Wurlitzer somewhat later, the tone of the Horn Diapason is
rather maligned in the literature.
Audsley describes it as having �a horny and somewhat stringy quality which fails 
to satisfy the sensitive musical ear�.
Bonavia-Hunt says �the quality of tone imparted by the slot to large or 
moderately-scaled diapason pipes is objectionable on account of its hybrid nasality�.
Wedgwood calls it �horny and sometimes somewhat �sugary� and cloying�,
and says that it �rapidly becomes wearisome�.
</p><p>
Not surprisingly, the <i>Horn Diapason</i> found a home in the theatre organ.
Strony writes:</p>
<blockquote>
A very useful top that is important in softer and mezzo forte accompaniment
registrations.  It is also important in building mezzo forte registrations
on the Great.  Unfortunately, it is missing from far too many instruments.
<br>
The Horn Diapason is one of those �in between� stops that is bright; yet
it has a good deal of fundamental.  Because of this, it is an excellent
<i>binder</i> for the flutes, strings, light reeds, and larger diapasons.
<br>
Wurlitzer included the Horn Diapason in many instruments between 13 and 17
ranks, and in most of their larger organs.
The 16' pitch is sometimes called 
<a href="../d/DiaphonicHorn.html">Diaphonic Horn</a>;
the 4' pitch is sometimes called <a href="../o/OctaveHorn.html">Octave Horn</a>.
</blockquote>
<p>
Irwin claims that it is <i>not</i> cloying, calling it �brass-like but not brilliant�.
Maclean likens it to the French <a href="../o/OpenDiapason.html">Montre</a> in
tone, and states that it �possesses in a very high degree an uncanny faculty
of blending with almost any other kind of pipe tone�.
</p><p>
According to Bonavia-Hunt, the slots, which favor the 5th, 6th and 7th partials,
are cut one pipe diameter away from the top of the pipe, and the widths of the
slots may vary from 1/3 to 1/5 of the pipe's diameter.
Grove dates it from the late 19th century.
</p><p>
In <i>The Art of Organ-Building</i> Audsley describes the Horn Diapason
as being of inverted-conical construction, which can have tonal effects
similar to slotting.  However, in his stop dictionary, published later,
he says nothing about Horn Diapasons being constructed in this manner,
nor does any other source.
