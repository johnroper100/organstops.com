<p>This stop is listed only by Irwin under the name <i>Bombarde Quinte</i>,
in which he says:</p>
<blockquote>
A Chorus Reed of 5-1/3' on the manuals, and 10-2/3' on the pedals,
formed from Bombarde pipes of less than average loudness and brilliance.
Since this stop froms the <i>third harmonic</i> of the sub-unison
series, it is found in only the largest organs, and should be drawn
only with a loud Chorus Reed, of 16' manual and 32' pedal pitch.
With the lighter-toned ensembles it creates tonal ensembles.
Reeds at these �quint� pitches have a limited use, which is mostly
to complete the louder choruses in the pedals and manuals.
<br> . . . <br>
The forty to sixty overtones that each pipe of the two ranks
would add to any ensemble are all completely off the pitches
of both the <i>notes</i> of the scale and the <i>overtones</i>
of all other ranks (except other stops of these same unusual
pitches).
</blockquote>
<p>Irwin is only half correct.  
If properly tuned, the overtones of any quint stop will be <i>exactly</i>
in tune with those of its relative unison pitch.
On an equally-tempered instrument, the only overtones that are
exactly in tune with their nearest notes on the keyboard are
those that sound at octaves.</p>
<p>Audsley also mentions this stop, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
In [Cavaill&eacute;-Coll's] notable scheme for the �Orgue Monumental� 
to be erected in St. Peter's, at Rome, we find in the Pedal Organ a 
<a href="../c/ContraBombarde.html">Contre-Bombarde</a>, 32 ft., a
<a href="Bombarde.html">Bombarde</a>, 16 ft., and a Quinte
Bombarde, 10-2/3 ft.  The tonal effect of these three commanding
voices in combination, heard in such a building as St. Peter's,
is beyond one's power to imagine.
</blockquote>
<p>The St. Peter's organ, first proposed in 1875, was never built.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p class=example>Bombard Quint 10-2/3', Pedal; Convention Hall,
	Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA; Midmer-Losh 1929-32.  (This stop is
	unified from a 32' rank, and thus is not properly in tune.)</p>
