<p>Strony lists this stop with the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
This rank was only included in Wurlitzers of 13 ranks or more.
In a Wurlitzer, the Brass Trumpet stop tab is merely labeled <i>Trumpet</i>,
which is much too generic.  Wurlitzer actually built two types of
theare organ trumpets: the Brass Trumpet and the
<a href="../t/TubaTrumpet.html">Style D Trumpet</a>.  The Style D
Trumpet is also labeled <i>Trumpet</i>.  There are major differences
in their tone.<br>
The Brass Trumpet appears on the manuals at 16' TC and 8'.
It sometimes appears in the pedal at 8'.  I do not know of
any Brass Trumpets that extend down to 16'.
</blockquote>
<p>
Some authorities identify a third type of Wurlitzer trumpet,
the <a href="../f/FrenchTrumpet.html">French Trumpet</a>.
Al Sefl provided the photograph of the D#52 pipe of a <i>Brass Trumpet</i>,
shot against a 1" grid.  He believes the pipe to be
of Wurlitzer origin, but with subsequent modifications.
The resonators have no slots, so the pipes are tuned by sliding
the resonators up and down a brass tube which is soldered to the block.
In the photograph the slip collar and its locking screw can be seen.
</p><p>
Irwin considers <i>Brass Trumpet</i> to be a synonym for 
<a href="../o/OrchTrumpet.html">Orchestral Trumpet</a>.
