<blockquote>
<p>The name given by its introducer, George W. Till, of Philadelphia, Pa. 
to a labial dual stop, formed of a metal 
<a href="../h/HarmonicFlute.html">Harmonic Flute</a>, 8 ft., 
having the compass of CC to C5, and a metal 
<a href="../s/Seventeenth.html">Tierce</a>, 3-1/5 ft., 
of the same compass, yielding pure organ-tone, and 
belonging to the 16 ft. harmonic series.  In this 
instance, however, the Tierce is a timbre-creating 
rather than a harmonic-corroborating stop or rank. 
In combination with the Harmonic Flute it produces 
a compound solo voice of an absolutely new and 
remarkable tone-color, impossible to be produced 
from a single-ranked Flute, however made and voiced.
</p><p>
This dual stop is inserted in the Choir of the Organ in the Wanamaker 
Store, in Philadelphia, where it speaks on wind of 15 inches.  The 
stop is unique; and it is safe to say that such a dual stop has never 
been even contemplated in the preparation of the tonal scheme for any 
other organ hitherto constructed.  We know of no Organ in which the 
component parts of the stop exist in any single manual division. 
The tone of the Tierce Flute must be heard, it cannot be described. 
It is especially a solo stop.</p>
