This name was used by John Compton for an 8' stopped flute of very
large scale, which Bonavia-Hunt gives as 2 1/8" at middle C,
and Wedgwood gives as 6" by 5" at CC for a wooden pipe, or
up to 6" for a metal pipe at CC.
It was made of wood or metal, or
metal with a wooden bass, similar in construction to the
<a href="TibiaClausa.html">Tibia Clausa</a> of Hope-Jones,
but having a very narrow mouth: 1/6, according to Bonavia-Hunt.
The upper lips were leathered, arched, and cut high, 1 3/4"
for a wooden CC, according to Wedgwood, who provides the
illustration reproduced here (click on it for a larger image). 
Irwin claims it is of small scale, but provides no further
details of construction or history.
The tone of Compton's <i>Tibia Minor</i> is described by
Wedgwood (and quoted by Audsley) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
The tone of the Tibia Minor is extremely effective.  In 
the bass it is round an velvety with a suspicion of smooth 
<a href="../f/FrenchHorn.html">French Horn</a> quality.  In
the treble the tone becomes very clear and full.  The top
notes of this stop, indeed, bear in them some resemblance to the
full liquid notes of the <a href="../o/Ocarina.html">Ocarina</a>,
though free, of course, from the undesirable features of that
instrument.  Whilst entirely devoid of the objectionable
hooting quality sometimes displayed by powerful Flutes, it
forms a solo stop of remarkably fine effect, and in combination
serves to add much clearness and fulness of tone to the treble,
and, in general, exercises to the fullest extent the beneficial
characteristics of the <a href="Tibia.html">Tibia</a>
class of stop.  If only by reason of the faculty so 
advantageously exercised, of thus mollifying and enriching
the upper notes of other stops - too often prone to become
hard, strident and thin in tone - the Tibia Minor deserved
recognition as one of the most valuable of modern tonal
inventions.
</blockquote>
<p>Bonavia-Hunt provides a less glowing review:
�The tone is superior to the tibia clausa, but both stops
fail in the treble register, which, admirable as it may
be for an abnormal solo effect, is very unsociable in
combination.�
Irwin, who is almost certainly not talking about Compton's
stop, says �its tone is smooth and pure, and lacks the
intense fundamental heard in many other Flutes�.
</p><p>
This name has also been used in Germany for a large-scale stopped
flute, the �minor� indicating a higher pitch than some other flute
stop.  On theatre organs it indicates the smaller of two
<a href="TibiaClausa.html">Tibia Clausas</a>.
