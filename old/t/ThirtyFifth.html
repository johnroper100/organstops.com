<blockquote>
A rank of Foundation pipes that is pitched at 2/7' on the manuals, and
4/7' on the pedals.  This is at the note four octaves and a flatted
seventh above the key depressed.  Since this rank sounds only in the
vicinity of the twenty-eighth harmonic, it will only partly corroborate
its pitch, assuming combination with a unison stop.  It speaks two
octaves above the 1-1/7' <a href="TwentyFirst.html">Septi&egrave;me</a>
on the manuals, and two octaves above the 2-2/7' Septi&egrave;me on
the pedalboard.  It is of use in some mixtures, but much too high for
a <a href="../_apps/Mutations.html">mutation</a> stop.  From middle C it
would speak at Bb5; from the pedal's low CCC key it speaks Bb2.
</blockquote>
<p>Irwin is incorrect.  A properly tuned 2/7' rank will, in fact, speak 
precisely at the 28th harmonic of the 8' series.
In an equally-tempered instrument this harmonic sounds only roughly at Bb,
not exactly; a rank tuned to speak precisely at Bb would be 
practically useless.
