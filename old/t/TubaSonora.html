<p>In 1895 Robert Hope-Jones introduced a new type of chorus reed tone,
the �close reed�, which Wedgwood says hyperbolizes as �an entirely new departure 
in the science of reed-voicing�.
Hope-Jones coined the name <i>Tuba Sonora</i> for his invention,
though in later years the names 
<a href="Tromba.html">Tromba</a> and 
<a href="../f/FrenchHorn.html">Horn</a> were
used for reeds of this type.
The first examples were voiced by Willis-trained E. Franklin Lloyd.
Bonavia-Hunt writes:
<blockquote>
The three main factors in the treatment of this class of reed are:
(1) closed shallots; (2) harmonic tubes - i.e., double length; and
(3) high wind pressure.  Willis as far back as 1870 had been using
all three in the treatment of his magnificent 
<a href="Tuba.html">tubas</a>: hence we see that Hope-Jones
tuba sonora was but the ultra-development of the Willis tuba in
the direction of closeness.  Somewhat thicker tongues were employed 
to enable the voicer to tune the reed to a closer (sharper) pitch
without causing the tongue to �choke�.  The tuning length of the
tongue was further controlled (shortened) in the lower half of the
compass by the process of loading, which was carried up an octave
and a half higher than in the Willis reed, the higher notes being
weighted with felt loads.  Franklin Lloyd adhered to the brass
weights with which his Willis training had familiarized him; but
later voicers introduced felt and lead weights in the bass and tenor
octaves, omitting the lead in the higher portion.  Another deviation
from the Willis standard was the increase of scaling adopted for this
type of reed.  The standard scales for chorus reeds set up by Willis
run from a maximum of 5in. to a minimum of 3 1/2 in. at CC (8 ft.).
... As much as 6 1/2 in. has been used for the tenor C (4 ft.) pipe
of a tuba, while at Worcester Cathedral Hope-Jones made the tenor F
pipe of his solo tuba to the enormous scale of 8in!
</blockquote>
<p>Early examples of the <i>Tuba Sonora</i> feature wooden shallots
with double tongues, including the one in Worcester Cathedral.  
Wedgwood reports that it has unusually thick tongues.
</p><p>
The tone of the <i>Tuba Sonora</i> has been characterized as full,
round, and pure, being free of most of the higher-pitched harmonics
that create dissonance and clang-tone.
Bonavia-Hunt says: 
�what the flute is to the diapason, the close reed is to the normal type�.
It is listed in all sources as being of 8' pitch.

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p class=example>Tuba Sonora 8', Solo; Worcester Cathedral, Worcester,
	England; Hope-Jones 1896.  This example is cited by Wedgwood and
	Audsley as a particularly fine one.</p>
<p class=example>Tuba Sonora 8', Tuba (division); St. Paul's Anglican Church, 
	Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Casavant 1914.
	(The chorus reeds of the Tuba division were made by
	Harrison and Harrison, and by Frank Wesson and W. G. Jones in
	England.)</p>
<p class=example>Tuba Sonora 16', 8', 4' (unified), Great; Spreckles 
	Organ Pavilion, Balboa Park, San Diego, California, USA; Austin 1915.</p>
<p class=example>Tuba Sonora 8', Solo; Town Hall, Melbourne, Australia;
	Hill, Norman & Beard 1929.</p>
<p class=example>Tuba Sonora 8', Harmonic; Cadet Chapel, United States Military Academy, West Point, New York,
	USA; Moller 1911.  This stop was apparently made in 1930 by Bonavia-Hunt.</p>
