During his association with the Wurlitzer Company, Hope-Jones produced
a mezzo-forte edition of [<a href="TubaSonora.html">Tuba Sonora</a>]
called Tuba Horn, as the basic chorus reed of the Wurlitzer Theatre organ.

<p>Strony provides more details:</p>
<blockquote>
The <a href="../h/HarmonicTuba.html">Harmonic Tuba</a> and Tuba Horn as
used in a Wurlitzer, are one and the same.  In its middle range, the
sound is dark and has a haunting quality.  The bottom notes resemble
the sound of a real symphonic tuba.
<br>
Virtually every theatre organ over 10 ranks has a Tuba Horn.  While this
is a wonderful sound, it comes on small organs with mixed blessings.  Its
sound is very round and dark; i.e. not very bright.  While it's pretty
when played with the <a href="Tibia.html">Tibias</a>, or as a solo
voice, it is not a sound that completes the full ensemble of a small
theatre organ.
<br>
It is an important filler sound that <i>binds</i> all of the brighter
sounds, like the Strings, Color Reeds, and Trumpet to the fundamental
sounds, like the Diapasons and Tibias.
<br>
Other builders made a totally different sounding Tuba Horn.  Some examples
are much brighter and more useful in smaller instruments where there is
only one chorus reed.  Barton, Morton, Kimball, and others made good
examples.
<br>
The Tuba Horn appears in the pedal division at 16' and 8' pitch.  On rare
occasions, it appears at 32' pitch.  In the manuals, it appears at 16',
8', and 4' pitch.
<br>
At 16' pitch, the Tuba Horn is sometimes called
<a href="../b/BassTuba.html">Tuba Profunda</a> or
<a href="../o/Ophicleide.html">Ophicleide</a>. At
4' pitch it is called <a href="../c/Clarion.html">Clarion</a>,
<a href="TubaClarion.html">Tuba Clarion</a>,
<a href="../h/HarmonicClarion.html">Harmonic Clarion</a>,
or even <a href="../c/ClarionHorn.html">Clarion Horn</a>.
<br>
In the Pedal Division, the Tuba Horn is usually the loudest 16' pedal
stop, although the 16' <a href="../d/Diaphone.html">Diaphonic Diapason</a>
is often fuller, but less bright.
</blockquote>

<p>Irwin claims that <i>Tuba Horn</i> is a synonym for
<a href="../b/BassHorn.html">Bass Horn</a>.
There are other varieties of
<a href="../h/HarmonicTuba.html">Harmonic Tuba</a>.
</p>
See also <a href="TubaTrumpet.html">Style D Trumpet</a>.

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Osiris contains a dozen examples of <i>Tuba Horn</i>, all in Wurlitzer 
theatre organs, unified to 16', 8' and 4' pitch, except for the following:

	Hope-Jones 1907.</p>
<p>
