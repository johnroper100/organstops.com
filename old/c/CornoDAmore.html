In <i>The Composition of the Organ</i>, Skinner describes the 
<i>Cor d'Amour</i> as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
A reed developed by the author.  Normally of 8' but occasionally of 16'
pitch, scaled as a very slender <a href="../t/Trumpet.html">Trumpet</a>
and capped.  The Cor d'Amour is useful throughout the scale, singly or
with other stops, and is a perfect solo voice without qualifying
characteristics.  It is best on a ten-inch pressure.  It is entirely
successful on pressures of 4 1/2" and above.  It is sometimes referred
to as an <a href="../o/Oboe.html">Oboe</a> with the defects removed.
The first example of the Cor d'Amour appeared in St. Paul's Church,
Cleveland, Ohio.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The pipes of the <a href="../f/FlugelHorn.html">Flugel Horn</a>, or Cor 
d'Amour, are scaled as diminutive <a href="../t/Trumpet.html">Trumpets</a>
and capped.  The shallots are the same as those of the conventional
<a href="../o/Oboe.html">Oboe</a>.  The scale and cap impart a tranquil
tonality, making an ideal solo voice.  An example on a ten inch wind, in
the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York City, is given a somewhat
intense or dramatic character by the unusual pressure.  On account of its
more musical character, the Cor d'Amour has replaced the Oboe in all
Skinner organs.  In small organs having but one reed, it is ideal.
</blockquote>
<p>
Skinner's claim of the first example of his Cor d'Amour is difficult
to corroborate.  According to Kinzey & Lawn's Skinner opus list, the
only Skinner organ for St. Paul's was installed in its parish house
in 1927, while earlier Skinner organs are known to have the stop
(see below).  The <a href="../f/FlugelHorn.html">Flugel Horn</a>
appears even earlier.  Volume 1 #3 of <i>Stop, Open and Reed</i> (1922)
contains the following description, believed to have been written
by Skinner:
</p>
<blockquote>
The Corno d'Amour is a singer. It has the warmth and temperamental
qualities peculiar to the violin although it is not imitative of this
instrument except in the upper register.  It is an ideal solo voice and
at the same time useful in the ensemble and as a soft trumpet. 
It has a very helpful influence in the quality of full organ.
</blockquote>
<p>
Irwin, the only other writer to describe this stop, says:</p>
<blockquote>
A solo Reed stop of 8' on the manuals, having a warm �singing� sound of
unusual sweetness for a Reed stop.  It is soft and not at all pungent,
like the <a href="../o/Oboe.html">Oboe</a>, or plaintive, like the
<a href="../m/Musette.html">Musette</a>.  Some examples have a considerable
body of tone, but most sound like a soft horn inclined towards a smooth
voicing.  The better specimens have a noticeable amount of inner resonance,
but this is unfortunately something one pipe can have and not another.
This <i>resonance</i> comes from a maximum of interplay between <i>all</i>
the pipe's dimensions, the sound wave meeting as little inner friction
as possible.  This produces a surprising strength in the tone, sometimes
as great as four to six times that expected, and without any hardness
or brittleness.  This Horn reinforces the softer flue stops in an
ensemble.  It may be a Solo or Echo stop.  Small-scale resonators with 
full caps and wide slots are often found.
</blockquote>

	USA; Skinner 1939.</p>
<p class=example>Cor d'Amour 8', Echo; Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey,
	USA; Midmer-Losh.</p>

<br>
<p class=example>Corno d'Amore 8', Swell; St. Ambrose R.C. Church, Endicott,
