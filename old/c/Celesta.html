A <a href="../p/percussion.html">percussion</a> stop consisting of a set of metal plates 
struck by hammers actuated by a pneumatic or electric mechanism.
According to Sumner, it is usually of 4' pitch, and may
utilize �tuning forks� instead of plates.
According to Audsley, the plates are placed over tuned resonators.
This stop is most often found in theatre organs.
<p>
Skinner describes the <i>Celesta</i> as �an orchestral reproduction 
developed by the author�,
of 4' pitch and full 61 note compass, and considers it synonymous with the
<a href="../g/Glockenspiel.html">Glockenspiel</a>, and with the
<a href="../h/Harp.html">Harp</a> at 8' pitch.
He reports that when the stop was originally developed, the bars and their 
resonators were arranged chromatically, and some notes in the lower register 
were nearly silent.  When the bars and their resonators were rearranged so
that adjacent notes of the scale were no longer physically adjacent, the
problem disappeared.
</p>
<p>
Maclean lists <i>Chrysoglott</i> as a Wurlitzer synonym for <i>Celesta</i>;
it is found only in theatre organs.
Irwin, the only other source to mention <i>Chrysoglott</i>, lists it
separately from <i>Celesta</i> but gives them identical descriptions.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>
Osiris contains dozens of examples of <i>Celesta</i>.  The earliest known examples
date from the 1910's but the earliest known Skinner examples date from the 1920's.
Osiris contains ten examples of <i>Chrysoglott</i>, all but one by Wurlitzer.

Our next purchase will be samples for a

that includes many stops for which we currently have no sound samples, including a 
Celesta.
