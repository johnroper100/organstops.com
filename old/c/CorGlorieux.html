<p>In 1897 Haskell invented a labial Saxophone stop, and first used it in the
Church of the Holy Trinity, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.
In <i>The Art of Organ-Building</i>, Audsley provides the drawing
reproduced here, along with the following description:
<p>


<blockquote>
This fine stop is of 8 ft. pitch, and extends throughout the manual compass.
Its scale is as follows: CC pipe, 3 5/16 inches in width by 4 3/16 inches in
depth; C pipe, 2 inches in width by 2 9/16 inches in depth; c1 pipe, 1 3/16
inches in width by 1 17/32 inches in depth; and c2 pipe, 3/4 inch in width by 
31/32 inch in depth.  The accompanying illustration, which gives a Front View
and Section of the sound-producing portion of the middle c1 pipe, shows a
formation almost identical with that in [Haskell's] labial
<a href="../o/OrchOboe.html">Oboe</a>.  The block is sunk 3/4 inch below the
lower lip.  The mouth is inverted, and its lower lip is sloped on the inside
of the pipe and slightly rounded.  The upper lip is filed to a very thin edge
in the same manner as that of the Oboe pipe.  The cap and the large cylindrical
harmonic bridge are so clearly shown that it is unnecessary to describe them.
Both the face of the lower lip and the opposite edge of the cap are closely
and sharply nicked.  The mouth is a small fraction over two-sevenths its width
in height.  The body of the pipe is of the same dimensions throughout its
length, and it is unslotted, being tuned by means of a metal shade at the top
in the usual manner.<br>
Voiced on wind of about 3 1/2 inches, this stop yields a tone exactly imitative
of that of the orchestral Saxophones.  It seems too much to expect that so
peculiar and complex a tone could be produced from wood pipes; but we have
satisfied our mind on the subject by testing the stop, as inserted in [the
Holy Trinity organ], by a direct comparison with the orchestral Saxophone,
performed upon in the Organ immediately alongside the stop.  While the 
imitation was practically perfect, in certain parts of its compass the
Saxophone of the Organ was, if anything, more pleasing than the corresponding
tones of the orchestral instrument.

The name �Cor Glorieux� was used by Estey for their labial Saxophone
in church organs where the name �Saxophone� was deemed inappropriate.
