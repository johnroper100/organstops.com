This name is given to a stop invented by Wolfgang Oberlinger and patented 
in 1997 by the firm of Oberlinger Orgelbau of Windesheim, Germany.
According Oberlinger's web site, it is intended to replace a 16' 
<a href="ContraBourdon.html">Subbass</a>, but requires only
about 1/7 as much space, about 0.13 cubic meters.
The illustration from Oberlinger's patent application is reproduced
below (click on it for a larger image), followed by
a translation of the patent's abstract.

<blockquote>
The sound body (2) is divided by inner walls (9) into chambers (10), 
where at least one labium (4) and at least one sound flap (6) is applied 
to each chamber. All labia and sound flaps are arranged on the front side 
(3) of the sound body. The labia have different widths. At least one part 
of the inner walls has wind passages (11). Each sound of the sound body 
is tunable by moving a body in the wind current in its interior via a 
slider. The sound body has a quadratic, rectangular, round or oval basic 
shape and the ratio of the length to the width or to the diameter is less 
than 5:1.

The idea of using one pipe body to produce more than one note did not
originate with Oberlinger, nor did the idea of using pipes of cubical
or nearly cubical shape.  Wedgwood provides the accompanying illustration,
and writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
�Boxes� and �Cubes�, into an orifice in which wind is directed,
have from time to time been made.  Their tone is apt to be
irregular, and ill-defined, and generally unsatisfactory.
The author, has, in his possession, however, a Cube of excellent
effect, made and voiced by Mr. Compton, the tone of which 
somewhat resembles that of the same builder's 
<a href="../t/TibiaMollis.html">Tibia Mollis</a>.
The lip is leathered.  Cube basses might be found of
great utility, when dealing with situations of some awkwardness.
</blockquote>
