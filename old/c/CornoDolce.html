This name has been used for a number of different stops.
Grove says that it is �either a soft reed stop (built by Serassi,
<i>c</i>1810) probably developed from Venetian 
<a href="../r/Regal.html">Regals</a>, or a wide Flute stop in
Italy (<i>c</i>1750-1900), sometimes in the form of an inverted cone.�
Williams supports that description, adding that it 
�could be a wide, wood <a href="../h/Hohlflote.html">Hohlfl&ouml;te</a>,
or open flute (Catania, 1750-55)�.
Wedgwood considers it to be a louder form of the
<a href="../f/FlautoDolce.html">Flauto Dolce</a>, usually having
inverted-conical pipes, but sometimes conical, and occasionally 
resembling the <a href="../w/Waldflote.html">Waldfl&ouml;te</a>.
Irwin describes it as moderate or large scale foundation stop of 
8' or 16' pitch, having a soft tone suggestive of a soft and 
delicate horn, usually slightly inverted conical in form, but 
sometimes cylindrical or slightly conical, made of either wood or metal.
Even Audsley seemingly cannot make up his mind:
in his stop dictionary he describes it as being of inverted conical
form, but having a flute tone without any horn quality;
in <i>The Art of Organ Building</i>, on the other hand, he
provides the following description and illustration:
</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="CornoDolce.gif"><img src="CornoDolce$.gif" align=right></a>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; The open wood stop to which this name has, apparently with some
propriety, been given is another of the creations of Mr. Thomas 
Pendlebury.  The tone of this fine stop is brighter than that 
of the true <a href="Clarabella.html">Clarabella</a> or
<a href="../h/Hohlflote.html">Hohlfl&ouml;te</a>.  In the tenor
and middle octaves the tone strongly resembles that of the 
orchestral Horn played softly; and it is this fact that has 
induced the inventor to name the stop Corno Dolce.  In his notes
on the stop, Mr. Pendlebury remarks: �In the tenor and middle
octaves the tone sounds much more pure in chords than in single
notes.  It has both body and brilliancy, yet the upper partial
tones, present in the compound voice of the pipes, do not stand
out in the self-assertive manner peculiar to those which belong
to the pungent voice of string-tone pipes.�
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;
The peculiar formation of the tone-producing portion of a
Corno Dolce pipe is shown in [the illustration reproduced here],
which is a Longitudinal Section of this portion of a middle c1
pipe.  The inverted mouth is cut in the wide side of the pipe,
and is kept moderately low; the block is slanted; the cap is
beveled internally; and the wind-way is kept very fine.  But
perhaps the most noteworthy feature of the pipe is thus mentioned
by the inventor: �In forming the throat, a hole as large as the
scale will allow is bored from the front right through the back
of the pipe.  This hole [shown shaded] is covered at the back
of the pipe with very soft leather [indicated at A], left
somewhat slack so as to receive the first shock of the wind.
This leather diaphragm also helps to neutralize the vibrations
of the wind in the throat and foot, which vibrations are of
greater detriment to the tone of labial pipes than is generally
realized.  On touching the diaphragm with the finger while the
pip is speaking the vibrations are distinctly felt.�  The most
favorable wind-pressure for this stop is 3 inches.  The following
dimensions give the most approved scale of the stop:

The pipes of the bass octave are formed similar to those of the
<a href="../g/Geigen.html">Geigenprincipal</a>, their mouths being
kept low and their wind-ways very fine.  The harmonic-bridges are
so placed as to produce a reedy rather than a stringy intonation.
The pipes of the tenor octave are modified so as to join the bass
to the treble tones in an artistic manner.  Alluding to the
dimensions above given, Mr. Pendlebury makes the following noteworthy
remarks: �It will be observed that the scales and the heights of
the mouths of the pipes of the tenor octave are nearly the same,
with the result that each pipe is slightly different in quality.
The beauty of the stop is not in any one particular pipe, but in
the <i>gradual changing</i> of the tone-color.
