<p>
In its quintessential form, the <i>Cornet</i> is a wide-scaled compound stop
without breaks, containing a third-sounding rank, often of short (treble) compass.
Like so many other organ stops, it has its origins in attempts to imitate
another instrument, in this case the Renaissance instrument known as <i>cornet</i>
or <i>zink</i>, which was blown in the manner of a brass instrument, but made of wood,
and furnished with finger-holes.
Early organ-builders used both reed stops and compound flue stops in their attempts
to imitate the instrument.
The classical stop is not related to the modern orchestral instrument called <i>cornet</i>
(see <a href="../o/OrchCornet.html">Orchestral Cornet</a>), although
the <i>Cornet</i> of the theatre organ is a 4' 
<a href="../t/Tuba.html">Tuba</a> or 
<a href="../t/Trumpet.html">Trumpet</a>.

Here we will deal only with the compound flue stop.  For reed forms,
see <a href="../z/Zink.html">Zink</a>.
</p><p>
There are alternate meanings for the word <a href="Corneta.html">Corneta</a>.
The name <i>Cornett</i>, as a synonym for <i>Cornet</i>,
appears only in passing in Audsley's entry for Echofl&ouml;te.
It is otherwise described as a synonym for <a href="../z/Zink.html">Zink</a>.
</p>

<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>
The organ stop named <i>Cornet</i> seems to have first appeared in Germany 
in the early 1500's, though it is not clear whether it was a reed stop or a mixture.
In this form it was known in the Netherlands from around 1560.
It appears in France from the late 1500's; early examples may have been progressive.
In the late 1500's, names such as
<a href="CornetzABoucquin.html">Cornetz a Boucquin</a> and
<a href="CornetDAllemagne.html">Cornet d'Allemagne</a> were common.
</p>
<h3>The Classical French Cornet</h3>
<p>
The most famous and most important Cornet stop occurred in the highly stylized
classical French organ, which always contained at least one Cornet, and sometimes
several.
It was a solo stop, almost invariably composed of the following five ranks:
<ol>
<li>Bourdon or Bourdon a Chemin&eacute;e 8'
<li>Prestant 4'
<li>Nasard 2-2/3'
<li>Quarte de Nasard 2'
<li>Tierce 1-3/5'
</ol>
The ranks were all of wide scale, and all open except for the 8'.
It occasionally appeared with IV ranks (minus the 8') or III ranks (minus the 8' and 4').
It was invariably of short compass, usually from middle C upwards.
Its tone was strong and penetrating.
It was often mounted on its own windchest, above the rest of its division
(see <a href="../m/MountedCornet.html">Mounted Cornet</a>).
</p><p>
According to Dom Bedos, the scales of the ranks of the Cornet were wider than
the individual stops of the same names.
He describes its tone as �brilliant and vigorous�.
He describes five different variations, according to the manual on which
the stop appears:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Grand Orgue</dt>
<dd>Sometimes called <a href="../g/GrandCornet.html">Grand Cornet</a>,
	this Cornet had a compass of two octaves, starting at middle C.
	It was intended to compensate for the weakness of the trebles of the
	<a href="../t/Trumpet.html">Trompette</a> and
	<a href="Clarion.html">Clairon</a>, and as such
	it was scaled wider in the treble and narrower at the bottom of its range.
	</dd>
<dt>Positif<dt>
<dd>This Cornet was similar in function, but of somewhat
	narrower scale than the Grand Cornet.
	</dd>
<dt>Bombarde</dt>
<dd>Sometimes called <a href="CornetDesBombardes.html">Cornet des Bombardes</a>,
	this Cornet was similar to the Grand Cornet.
	</dd>
<dt>R&eacute;cit</dt>
<dd>Sometimes called <a href="CornetDeRecit.html">Cornet de R&eacute;cit</a>,
	this Cornet was a solo stop, and had a compass of 2 1/2
	octaves, starting at tenor F or G.  Bedos contrasts it to the
	Grand Cornet in that it is narrower in the treble, and wider in
	its lower range.
	</dd>
<dt>&Eacute;cho</dt>
<dd>Sometimes called Cornet d'&Eacute;cho, this Cornet was similar
	to the Cornet de R&eacute;cit, though it might be slightly narrower
	in scale, and its compass might be as much as 3 octaves.
	</dd>
</dl>

</p><p>
Williams provides the following scaling information.
The scales are in millimeters at middle C.

<h3>England</h3>
<p>
The early English Cornet, like the French <i>Cornet de R&eacute;cit</i>,
was a large-scale solo mixture of IV or V ranks and short compass.
Its tone was prominent but not loud, and was not used with the reeds.
It was much in favor from the late 1600's through the early 1800's,
after which it fell into disfavor along with the cornet voluntaries
which were widely written for it.
</p>
<h3>Spain</h3>
<p>
The Spanish <i>Corneta</i>, according to Williams, was
�usually of more ranks than V in the larger organs; gentler in tone than 
the French </i>Cornet</i>, being necessary neither for frequent solos
nor for boosting the reed trebles�.  Williams provides the following
additional description:
<blockquote>
Although sometimes called <i>Tolosana</i> because they came to Spain from 
Toulouse [France] in about 1620, Spanish Cornets have little in common with
the French classical stop of that name.  Cornets with III-V ranks of 
wide-scaled, highly leaded pipes pervaded France, England and parts of
Germany by 1700; but the Spanish cornets were quite different, having up
to 12 ranks of relatively narrow scale, sometimes conical pipes, often in
a Swell-box, occasionally of full-compass, always with a
<a href="../s/Seventeenth.html"><i>Tierce</i></a>,
<a href="../f/Fifth.html">Sub-<i>Tierce</i></a> or
<a href="../t/TwentyFourth.html"><i>Octave Tierce</i></a>
and sometimes with 19th and 22nd ranks also (<i>Corneta Clara</i>,
�clear Cornet�).  The tone was light, rather delicate, with very little
of the French <i>&eacute;lan</i>.  Mouths were narrow - <i>Octave</i>
ranks one quarter, <i>Quints</i> one-sixth, <i>Tierces</i> one-fifth.
Though adequate solo stops, they could play chords; they also
demonstrate the Spanish builders' reluctance to keep to one particular
design.
</blockquote>
The Spanish stop names often had qualifiers; e.g. 
<a href="CornetaClara.html"><i>Corneta Clara, Corneta Reale</i></a>.
Here are some examples of Spanish <i>Corneta</i> compositions:
</p>
III: 8, 12, 17 (Cadireta, Granada Cathedral; 1745)<br>
III: 12, 15, 17 (Cadireta, Palacio Real, Madrid; 1778)<br>
III: 22, 24, 26 (Manual II (left), Lisbon, Portugal; de Fora <i>c</i> 1770)<br>
IV: 8, 12, 15, 17 (New Cathedral, Salamanca; 1700)<br>
V: 8, 12, 15, 17, 19  (Cadireta, New Cathedral, Salamanca; 1744)<br>
VI: 1, 8, 10, 12, 15 (Organo Grande, Granada Cathedral; 1745)<br>
VI: 1, 8, 12, 17, 19, 22 (Choir Organ, Toledo; 1796-97)<br>
VII: 1, 8, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22 (Organo Grande; New Cathedral, Salamanca; 1744)<br>

<h3>Romanticism</h3>
<p>
During the Romantic period, much was forgotten about earlier styles
of organ music and organ-building, including the construction and use
of the Cornet.  
Critics of the period mistakenly believed that the classical Cornet
was extremely loud. 
The name came to be used for mixtures of widely
different types, often for large high-pitched mixtures of narrow
scale, even string scale.
Bonavia-Hunt goes so far as to call it obsolete.
</p>
<h3>Neo-Classicism</h3>
<p>
With the neo-classic "revolution" of the 20th century attempting
to return to earlier practices, mutations were given smaller scales,
narrow mouths, or tapered pipes, resulting in an "oo" sound rather
than the broad "aa" sound (as in "share").
The true Cornet is composed not of flutes, but of principals of
large scale and dull tone, except for the 8' rank which is usually
a stopped or chimney flute.
