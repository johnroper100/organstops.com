Listed only by Irwin, who says:
<blockquote>
A <i>conical harmonic</i> metal Flute of 8' or 4' manual pitch.  The
tone of this unusual combination of pipe-structures is unusually 
transparent and luminous, owing to the fact that it comes from a
small chord of on-pitch partials down near the fundamental's pitch.
It is bright without being stringy, delicate without being hard to
hear clearly, and distinct in pitch alone as a solo voice or in
combination with other flue stops.  The conical shape (of the 
<a href="../g/Gemshorn.html">Gemshorn</a>)
gives it partials near the range of its fundamental, and the harmonic
structure gives it a roundness and smoothness of tone that conical
ranks generally do not have.  It lacks the conspicuous effect on the
ear of the <a href="../d/Doppelflote.html">Doppelfl&ouml;te</a>; its
beauty must be carefully listened for.  Some organists consider it a
superior kind of <a href="../h/HarmonicFlute.html">Harmonic Flute</a>,
but it lacks that Flute's penetration and power in combination.  A
high percentage of tin enhances its bright quality.  It may be smaller
in scale than the Gemshorn.  Its dynamic range varies with its scale,
the bigger scales naturally being somewhat louder.
</blockquote>
