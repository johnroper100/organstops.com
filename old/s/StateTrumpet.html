<p>Irwin describes this stop as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
A brilliant and unusually loud Chorus Reed of 8' on the manuals,
designed to imitate the state trumpeters in the European cathedrals
who announce by fanfares the entrance of a king or bishop.  The
tone is commanding, harmonically full, and usually of such volume
of sound that it can overwhelm the full organ, or at least sound
in contrast to it.  
Such Reeds are merely loud <a href="../t/Tuba.html">Tubas</a>
or <a href="../t/Trumpet.html">Trumpets</a>, perhaps
<a href="../o/Ophicleide.html">Ophicleides</a>, that are voiced
to sound their fundamentals as well as their extensive trains
of overtones to practically the maximum degree of development
for a Reed.  The unison or harmonic-length resonators are usually
installed horizontally in front of the main organ or at some point
distant from the main organ.  This position enables the pipes more
easily to move the air-volume in the whole church or cathedral
than if they were installed vertically up against the ceiling of
an organ chamber.  The many dissonant harmonics that give these
loud Reeds such a cymbal-like and stately sound are thus able
to reach the listener's ear without being absorbed by the walls
and other structures on the way.  These harmonics that spell the
difference between this type of Trumpet and the average Trumpet
of the organ are mostly high-pitched and also quite perishable
because of their softness.
<p>
Specifically, the <i>State Trumpet</i> built by the Aeolian Skinner
Organ Company at the west end of the long nave, high up under the
large rose window, in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New
York City.  This company, which also rebuilt the 140-rank organ
at the east end above the choir, experimented extensively to
find a Trumpet tone worthy of this huge Gothic edifice.  The
State Trumpet is stunningly brilliant and possesses all of the
clang and brass formant necessary to make it realistic.
