<p>Audsley lists this stop in his dictionary of organ stops
with the accompanying illustration
and the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="SuaveFlute.gif"><img src="SuaveFlute$.gif" align=right></a>
A name, sugested by the Latin <i>suavis</i> - sweet, pleasant; and
which we have considered appropriate for a flute-toned stop of
peculiar formation, and of singularly smooth and agreeable tonation.
The pipes of the stop are of wood, open, and of medium scale; their
peculiarity obtaining in the formation of the mouth, the upper lip
pof which has a cylindrical piece of polished hard wood attached
to it.  This form of mouth clearly demonstrates the value of the
thick and rounded upper lip in the production of smooth and full
flute-tone.  Organ-builders of today have resorted to the easy,
objectionable, and perishable expedient of covering the upper lip
with leather in both metal and wood pipes.  It is a cheap expedient
to save labor and care in voicing.
</blockquote>
<p>In <i>The Art of Organ-Building</i> Audsley equates this stop with the
<a href="SuabeFlute.html">Suabe Flute</a>, saying that the
latter �could be properly called Suave Flute�.  In his stop
dictionary, published some years later, he lists both stops separately.
Irwin also lists it, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
An open wooden Flute of 8' or 4' on the manuals, of moderate scale
and a soft volume, and a tone color that may be described as <i>smooth</i>
(without peaks of loudness in the harmonics), <i>dulcet</i> (with a
pleasing balance between the lowest four harmonics), and <i>comparatively
dull</i> (of about twelve to sixteen partials).  The high upper lips
are rounded and very thick to discourage formation of the higher
partials.
</blockquote>
