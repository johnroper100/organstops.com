The best imitation of the orchestral Saxophone has been achieved by Haskell
using labial (flue) pipes; labial Saxophones are described under 
<a href="../c/CorGlorieux.html">Cor Glorieux</a>.
Reed saxophone stops are large-scale <a href="../c/Clarinet.html">Clarinets</a>,
found at 16' or 8' pitch; most sources describe them as being rather less than
completely successful.
Free reeds have also been used; see <a href="../c/ContraSaxophone.html">Contra Saxophone</a>.
Regarding the Brass Saxophone, Strony writes:
<blockquote>
This is one of the most sought after voices in modern day theatre organs.
Original Brass Saxophone pipes are made of spun brass, and look like small brass
trumpets.  Unfortunately, many examples did indeed sound like small trumpets.
</blockquote>
Maclean describes Wurlitzer's brass Saxophone as having half-length resonators,
and a �somewhat raucous� tone �bearing but little resemblance to that of the
actual band instrument�.  He also describes another interesting example:
<blockquote>
There is an interesting reed Saxophone by Anton Gottfried in the C.B.C.
studio organ, Toronto [Ontario, Canada].  The resonators are mainly
cylindrical, with a narrow, flared bell at the top.  The same builder
also experimented with the productionof Oboe and Saxophone tones from
what he called �Flat-Front� open metal pipes, in which about one third
of the circumference was flat, and parallel to the mouth.
</blockquote>
Other attempts to imitate the saxophone have employed compound stops.
Bonavia-Hunt says �it is perhaps best imitated on the organ by using a fairly
powerful <a href="../c/Clarinet.html">clarinet</a> and 
<a href="../v/Violoncello.html">violoncello</a>.�
Audsley suggests combining the 
<a href="../b/BassetHorn.html">Corno di Bassetto</a> and
<a href="../v/Viol.html">Viol</a>.
