<blockquote>
A rank of Foundation pipes that speaks at 1 7/9' on the manuals, and
3 5/9' on the pedals.  This is at the note two octaves and one note
above the key struck.  This pitch is not a common harmonic of any series
of stops on the organ, but may be seen in the ancillary Harmonic division
of a very large instrument.  It can add an unusual variety of brassiness
to a loud chorus of Reeds, but it must be remembered that it brings with
it a whole train of partials from its own pipes, at least twelve, if the
pipes are open metal <a href="../o/OpenDiapason.html">Diapasons</a> or
<a href="../g/Geigen.html">Geigen Diapasons</a>.  Sometimes pipes as soft
as <a href="../d/Dulciana.html">Dulciana</a> pipes are used for ranks of
these unusual pitches to keep the tone from being too assertive.  From
the middle C key this rank sounds at D<font size=-1>3</font>, and from the
low pedal CCC key, at D (below middle C).  The manual pitch is between
the 2' and 1-3/5' pitches.
</blockquote>
<p>This <a href="../_apps/Mutations.html">mutation</a> stop reinforces the 9th
harmonic of the 16' harmonic series in the manuals, and of the 32' harmonic
series in the pedal.
When played from a C key on an instrument tuned to equal temperament,
its pitch is only approximately at D, not exactly.
