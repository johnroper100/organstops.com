<p>Irwin implies that <i>Schulze Diapason</i> is a stop name in its own right,
though no examples are known.  He says:</p>
<blockquote>
The <i>Schulze</i> Diapason, named for one of the early English builders
(who had come from Germany), is still venerated by builders and organists
alike because of its ideal tone.  Several magnificent examples of this
<a href="../o/OpenDiapason.html">Diapason</a> are still to be heard in
England.  Voicers have sought to imitate its tone for many years.  Careful
measurements, comparison by ear, analysis of its harmonics, and plain 
guessing have all failed to make an exact copy.  The formant of the windchest
as well as the pipes themselves seems to contribute much to the tone quality.
The tone is animated, �vital,� and seems brighter than the best of the
regular Diapasons.  Undoubtedly this Stradivarius holds much the same
secrets of tonal eminence as the famous violin: a particular pattern of
<i>internal resonances</i> which vitalizes the ear without actually being
louder or more brilliant with overtones.  Physically, both the violin and
the Diapason jump into vibration <i>in fewer thousandths of a second</i>
than other specimens of their kind.  This shortening of the initial
period and the steady harmonic structures account for part of the tonal
difference.  Other factors may still remain secrets.  Noel A. Bonavia-Hunt
of England has had extensive experience in building and voicing Diapasons
of the Schulze design.  He relates many interesting facts in the case in
his unusually complete book on the organ, <i>The Modern British Organ</i>.
