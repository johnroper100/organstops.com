This stop was brought to my attention by Christopher Thompson, who wrote:
<blockquote>
Exclusively used by the John Compton Organ Company, England
in the early 1930's.  It was a patent of this firm and available at 4ft only
and until the last few years was never found outside the UK.  The Solo 
Cello was employed exclusively on the Solo manual of the firm's theatre 
organs up until 1935 when it was replaced by the more versatile 
<a href="../m/Melotone.html">Melotone</a> 
unit.  The Solo Cello was an amplified cello string whereby a rotating resin
wheel touched the string as soon as this stop was applied.  Mechanical 
fingers at the desired harmonic points touched the string as the notes were
played.  Due to the complexity of this device it was prone to failure and 
also impossible to keep in tune with the rest of the organ which is most 
probably why it fell out of favour almost from the start.  Today only 3 or 4
survive in working order in the United Kingdom.
</blockquote>

There is also a conventional flue string stop called
<a href="SoloCello.html">Solo 'Cello</a>.

<h2>Examples</h2>
