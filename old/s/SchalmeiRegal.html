<p>Listed only by Irwin, who says:</p>
<blockquote>
A variety of <a href="../r/Regal.html">Regal</a>, at 8', 4' or 2' on the 
manuals, and 8' or 4' on the pedals, yielding an intensely brilliant tone 
that sugests that acid whine of the <a href="Schalmei.html">Schalmei</a> 
as well as the windy, piping, thin tone of most Regals.  It is a hybrid 
that joins in one stop two large tribes of short-resonatored Reeds: the 
Schalmeis and the Regals.  The functions are the same as those of the 
Regals, except that this stop sounds more appropriately by itself in 
countermelody than most Regals.  The resonators amplify just a certain 
range of partials, this range changing somewhat from higher to lower 
as the scale is ascended.  The very short pipes usually break back to 
a greater length towards the top of the compass of the stop.  Narrow 
brass tubes (sometimes of spotted metal) from one-eighth to one-quarter 
of the unison lengths sit on the tops of the boots.  On the tops of 
these narrow cylinders may be brass bells of long slender form or 
short wide form, depending upon the type of tone desired.
