<p>Irwin lists this stop with the following description:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A Foundation stop of 16', 8', or 4' on the manuals, and 16' or 8'
on the pedals.  It has the essential tone of the 
<a href="../o/OpenDiapason.html">Diapason</a>: a strong
fundamental and a harmonic series developed to just below
the point where dissonant harmonics (not spurious harmonics)
enter the tone.  Many examples of this stop are moderately
soft, and <a href="../m/Mixture.html">mixture</a> ranks
are frequently formed by it. Its unique feature is that the
otherwise cylindrical pipes are made just slightly conical
in shape for their whole speaking lengths.  This form
prevents many of the higher-pitched harmonics from being
created, and places the energy of the air-column more in
the <i>lower</i> chord of harmonics.  Those eliminated
by this shape are betwen approximately the sixteenth and
twenty-third, varying, of course, with scale and wind
pressure.  The second and fifth harmonics are almost
always noticeably strengthened by a conical flue pipe.
Nor is the taper so great that the even-numbered harmonics
are eliminated, but the odd-numbered are somewhat strengthened,
presenting a clear, full tone.  The stronger odd-numbered
harmonics develop a luminous, clean, but not �cold� tone
that is of easy blend with all types of stops.  To say
the tone is �reedy� or �stringy� does not describe this
timbre, these two effects demanding a great number of
high-pitched patials.
</p><p>
In the treble notes these pipes, even at large scale, have
a bell-like clarity without that fringe of shrillness sometimes
heard from cylindrical ranks.  The bass pipes are strong in
fundamental gorund tone and perhaps seem a little duller to
the ear, but they contribute powerful components to the
ensemble that are very valuable.  The conical Foundation
ranks are not superior to the cylindrical pipes in the
Diapason Chorus, because their sparsity of harmonics will
not mesh so well with ranks higher in pitch, such as an
8' with a 4', or a 4' with a 2-2/3' rank.  Thus the
fa&ccedil;ade of tone cannot be erected altogether by
this type of Diapason.  Sometimes just the 
<a href="../_apps/Mutations.html">mutation</a> pitches
are conical, being perhaps three-quarters to seven-eighths
of the mouth0line diameter at the pipes' tops.  Even the
tuning collars are conical in form too.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In his entry for <a href="Spitzgamba.html">Cone Gamba</a>,
Wedgwood says �The stop known as Cone Diapason is practically
a distinction without a difference.  Its tone, if anything,
inclines rather more to that of a reedy Diapason.�  Elsewhere
he mentions <i>Pyramid-Diapason</i> as a synonym.
Maclean lists <i>Pyramid Diapason</i> as �the name given by
Henry Erben to a kind of Gemshorn Diapason or Spitzprincipal�, 
and cites the St. Patrick's example (see below).

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Osiris contains over 50 examples of <i>Spitzprinzipal</i>
and <i>Spitz Principal</i>; about half of which are at 4',
somewhat less than half are at 8', four are at 2', and one at 16'.
It contains two examples of <i>Diapason Conique</i>
No examples of the names <i>Cone Diapason, Gemshorn Diapason,
Pyramid-Diapason,</i> or <i>Spitz Diapason</i> are known.
