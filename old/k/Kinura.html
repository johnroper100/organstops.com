<p>An 8' or 4' reed stop of the <a href="../r/Regal.html">Regal</a> class, 
invented by Hope-Jones and found almost exclusively on theatre organs.
Few sources outside the theatre organ world have anything complimentary 
to say about the tone of the <i>Kinura</i>, likening it to a thin or 
poorly voiced Oboe.  Irwin describes it as
�a great mass of <i>inharmonic</i> as well as <i>harmonic</i> partials
that merely approximate the pitches of the notes�.
Strony describes it as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
This stop is the clown of the theatre organ.  Its �bee in the bottle�
sound has been the essence of many a novelty tune for many years.
Every theatre organ over ten ranks has one.  Examples range from the
extremely �pushy� sets built by Gottfried and Morton; to the middle
of the road sound built by Wurlitzer; and finally, to the more 
transparent and delicate sound favored by Kimball.
This stop is rarely, if ever, used alone by itself.
</blockquote>
<p>Wedgwood provides the following information regarding the
construction of the <i>Kinura</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
The original experiments in the construction of this stop were conducted
with cylindrical brass tubes continued through the block and forming the 
shallot or reed.  They were made of brass tubing, with a long �flat� filed
through a considerable part of one side.  On to this was soldered a brass
plate, against a slit in which the tongue was seated.  In other cases this
shallot extended about one-third the distance up into the reed tube.  The
bore at middle C was about 1/4 in. diameter; but the tongues were so thin
that it was practically impossible to complete the compass.  Eventually
the stop was made like the <a href="../o/Oboe.html">Oboe</a>, or of
small-scaled half-length tubes, pierced at the top and surmounted by an
adjustable hood-shaped lid.
</blockquote>
<p>Irwin describes it as having extremely short inverted-conical resonators
with extremely wide flare.
The name <i>Kinura</i> is a Greek word meaning a 10-string harp.
