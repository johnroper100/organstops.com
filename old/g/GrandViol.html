<p>Audsley lists this stop with the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
The name employed to individualize the most important unison (8 ft.)
stop yielding unimitative viol organ-tone, inserted in an Organ:
in this respect occupying a more commanding position, tonally,
than the <a href="Geigen.html">Geigenprincipal</a>, 8 ft.
An example exists in the unexpressive Subdivision of the First
or Great Organ of the principal Organ in the Church of Our Lady
of Grace, Hoboken, N.J. [New Jersey, USA].
</blockquote>
<p>In his entry for <i>Geigenprincipal</i>, Audsley states
that a �better English term� for that stop would be <i>Grand Viol</i>.</p>
<p>Irwin also lists <i>Grand Viol</i>, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
A String stop of 8' on the manuals, having a solo tone quality
similar to the <a href="../o/OrchViolin.html">Orchestral Violin</a>
stop, but of much keener and more assertive effect than this stop
usually has.  It is also useful as the loudest unison rank of a
String Organ, for it can blend with the brilliant and incisive
stops of this division.  Its cutting, pungent, loud tone is
unsuitable for any of the organ's regular divisions (Great, Swell,
Choir, Solo), because its dissonant harmonics (and inharmonics)
would clash with the notes of the equal-tempered scale, as sounded
by the fundamentals of other stops.  Some of this clashing is
pleasant and some unpleasant, and the amount tolerated must be
judged by the muscal function of the organ in question.  The
smaller scales of this String naturally have more dissonance
within one pipe's tone than the larger scales.  The scale of the
8' <a href="../v/Violone.html">Violone</a> is assumed by some
specimens, and others have a scale so small at low CC that it is
little more than one inch inside the pipe.  Smaller scales induce
hardness as well as dissonance, and have less fundamental with
which to sound the melody's pitches.  The pipes are constructed
like those of the other Viols.
