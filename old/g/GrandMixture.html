This stop is listed only by Irwin, who says:</p>
<blockquote>
A stop name that refers to a manual or pedal mixture of unusual
completeness in its harmonic pitches.  Its open metal (or wood)
ranks add <i>a complete chord of harmonics</i> to any
combination, solo or ensemble.  Its pitches are based on the
unison open-pipe partials.  The lowest eight are represented.
Examples on other pitch series can be formed.
<br> . . .<br>
Individual ranks in the above mixture are at different degrees
of volume, perhaps also different in tone quality, in order to
give the sound unity of effect.  The octave-sounding ranks
are louder than the other ranks, the unison ranks being the
loudest.  The fifth-sounding ranks are less loud, and perhaps
conical in form.  The third-sounding ranks are quite soft to
keep them from injecting too much sharp quality.  The 
flatted-seventh-sounding ranks are very soft, perhaps

to keep them from being �gritty� in the ear.
</blockquote>
<p>Audsley mentions it only in passing:
�The term <i>grand</i> has been applied to other stops
for the purpose of indicating their relative importance;
we, accordingly, find such terms as ... Grand Mixture.�</p>
