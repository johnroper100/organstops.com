A free-reed stop of 16' or 8' pitch, imitative of the instrument of the same name:
a tenor or baritone tuba similar to the baritone horn, a member of the saxhorn family, 
invented in the 1840's by Adolphe Sax.
It is interesting to note that Grove and Williams date this stop from around 1820,
and the first recorded example was at Beauvais Cathedral in
1827-29, thus predating Sax's instrument by at least fifteen years.
In 1790 Chladni invented an instrument of the same name using glass
plates and rods, but it is difficult to imagine how such an instrument
could have inspired an organ stop of this type.  It is possible that
the stop's inventor simply made up the name from the Greek words
meaning �good sound�.
The German name for this instrument is <a href="../b/Baryton.html">Baryton</a>.
</p>
<p>
Skinner and Irwin consider the <a href="Euphonium.html">Euphonium</a>
to be a different stop; see that entry for further discussion.
</p>
<p>
The original <i>Euphone</i> had resonators that Wedgwood describes as
�cylindrical in body, terminating in a long cone�.
It was capable of expression by varying the wind pressure via a console device.
(See also <a href="../c/Conoclyte.html">Conoclyte</a> and
<a href="../t/Terpomele.html">Terpomele</a>.)
Another expressive <i>Euphone</i> was introduced by Sebatian Erard in 1830,
which featured covered, slotted, somewhat balloon-shaped resonators as
shown in the illustration above left, reproduced from Wedgwood.
Its tongues were broad and thin.
During Wedgwood's time, <i>Euphones</i> were made in the form shown
in the illustration above center, reproduced from the same source.
Audsley provides the illustration reproduced above right, with
the following description:
</p>
<blockquote>
Different forms of resonators have been devised, some of very peculiar
form, but those most approved are either of the plain inverted conical
form, shorted and of smaller scale than thsoe used for the
<a href="../t/Trumpet.html">Trumpet</a>, as adopted by Roosevelt;
or of the same form surmounted by some contracting or shading device,
preferably a short truncated cone, as shown at the top of the
resonator in the drawing of the complete pipe, 2.  In other, less
effective, examples the inverted conical resonators are closed at
the top and slotted for the emission of wind and sound.  The drawings
are accurately made to scale from a C (4 ft. pitch) pipe constructed
by the well-known make, August Luakhuff.  All free-reed pipes require
for their prompt and satisfactory speech large boots; and this is shown
in the Section 1, which also shows the free-reed, the block in which it
is inserted, and the tuning-wire.  The length of the boot is 13 3/4 inches,
while the entire length of hte resonator is only 25 2/4 inches.  The
largest diameter of the resonator is 2 7/8 inches, and that of the opening
at top 1 1/2 inches.  The length of the tongue is 2.25 inches and its
width 0.27 inch.
</blockquote>
<p>
Skinner has the following additional observations regarding the <i>Euphone</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
The pipe is very difficult to tune because of its acute sensitivity to
the acoustical influences of both body and feet.  To ensure reliable
pitch and speech, the foot should have a resonance in sympathy with
the barrel.  Otherwise, the reed is subject to acoustical interference.
</blockquote>
<p>
According to Grove, the <i>Euphone</i> is often made without resonators.
The tone of this stop varies considerably.
Irwin calls it �muffled, reedy, somewhat pungent�, while Audsley
calls it �open, smooth and full�.
