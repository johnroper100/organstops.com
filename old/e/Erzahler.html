<p>This stop was invented in 1904 by Ernest M. Skinner, who says in his
<i>Composition of the Organ</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>Erz&auml;hler:</i> German, literally �story teller�; an early invention
of the author.  An 8' stop, strongly tapered, which is hybrid in charactar.
It is neither flute, string nor diapason; has a light voice; yet will sound
through a considerable amount of tone.  It has a talkative quality and
varying moods and stands unenclosed in the Great organ.  The top of these
pipes is one fourth the diameter at the mouth and sounds the first upper
partial, or octave, in equal prominence with the foundation tone.
Historically, this stop represents an interesting modification of the old
<a href="../v/ViolaDAmore.html">Viol d'Amour</a> in which the bells were
cut off.  To obtain the correct pitch, a transposition of pipes was
necessary, dues to the shortening by removal of the bells.  In revoicing,
certain notes were found to have a prominent octave harmonic.  This
quality was developed in all the notes by a precise regulation of wind.
An increase in physical peculiarities resulted in the form shown in
Audsley's <i>The Art of Organ Building</i>, Vol. II, page 564 [reproduced here].
Later modifications further deveoped the unusual character of this voice,
which now bears little resemblance to the original.  It was named
Erz&auml;hler, meaning storyteller, owing to its talkative character.
It named itself.  (See <a href="../k/Kleinerzahler.html">Kleiner Erz&auml;hler</a>.)
The first example of the Erz&auml;hler appeared in the Dutch Reformed
Church, Kingston, New York.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The Erz&auml;hler ... apparently changes color to suit its surroundings.
The Erz&auml;hler is the chameleon of organ stops.  It is unique and
does not resemble the tone of other tapered stops such as the
<a href="../g/Gemshorn.html">Gemshorn</a> or 
<a href="../s/Spitzflote.html">Spitz Flute</a>.
I am almost prepared to say it forms a fifth family of tone. ...
At tenor C its scale at the mouth is 57.  Its top is one quarter the
mouth diameter.  It has a 1/6 mouth, cut up 1/3 its width.  The
Erz&auml;hler may be tuned with sleeves if properly fitted.  All pipes
of the lower octave of the Erz&auml;hler are scale alike at the mouth,
namely 57.  The tops are graduated from 55/64" at B to 1-51/62" at CC.
Continuing the normal scale downward develops excessive power. ...
The Erz&auml;hler has small ears except in the upper octave, which is
not tapered.
</blockquote>

<p>
According to Audsley, who provides the illustration reproduced here,
gives the mouth height as 1/5, rather than 1/6 as specified by Skinner,
and describes the pipes as being slotted.
He describes its tone as �compound and singularly bright�. 
Irwin has this to say:
</p>
<blockquote>
It serves as a binding tone between bright and dull stops,
high-pitched and low-pitched stops, and the unisons and the mutations
and mixtures.  The fundamental and octave components are both noticeable.
The rest of the train of overtones contains elements of the String,
open Flute, and Foundation stops, without any color-forming fringe
of the very high-pitched overtones.  It is available in many degrees
of loudness and scale.
</blockquote>
<p>
The Erz&auml;hler is nearly always found at 8' pitch, though 4' and 16' 
versions have been made.
According to legend, Skinner asked a German employee for a German word 
that would express the idea of �chatty� or �garrulous�.
The employee suggested the word <i>erz&auml;hler</i>, meaning �narrator� or
�storyteller�.
Legend also has it that Henry Willis III copied Skinner's invention
and renamed it <a href="../s/Sylvestrina.html">Sylvestrina</a>.

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Osiris contains about 150 examples, about 80% of which are by
E. M. Skinner or Aeolian-Skinner.  Two are at 16' pitch, one at 4',
and the rest are at 8'.  Two-thirds of the E. M. Skinner organs
listed in Osiris contain <i>Erz&auml;hlers</i>.</p>
