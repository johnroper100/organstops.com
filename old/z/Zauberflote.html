<p>
A stopped harmonic flute of 8', 4' or 2' pitch, invented by
Michell & Thynne of London, and first introduced by them in
an organ built for the London Inventions Exhibition of 1885,
and later moved to Tewkesbury Abbey.
Its name means �magic flute�, after the Mozart opera of the same name.
A stopped harmonic pipe has a length three times that of a
normal stopped pipe speaking the same pitch.
Wedgwood, who provides the illustration reproduced here,
describes the tone of the Zauberfl&ouml;te as full, liquid and pure, 
with a �suspicion of stringiness�.
Irwin reports that the pipes have very large ears for stabilizing the
tone and for tuning, but this was not a feature of Thynne's original stop.
Bonavia-Hunt provides the following description of the
original:</p>
<blockquote>
From tenor C to top, the pipes are stopped, three times the normal
length, and overblown to speak the twelfth.  Wood is used from
tenor C to E (five notes), and the remainder of the stop from tenor
F is of metal.  The scale of the tenor C pipe is 2 3/4 in. by 
2 1/8 in., its length being 33 1/2 in. from the block.  A node-hole,
1/16 in. in diameter, is pierced at a distance of nine-sixteenths
of the speaking length of the pipe from the upper lip.  The scale
of the mid. C note (treb. C note) is 1 15/16 in., its length being
16 3/4 in. from the upper lip, with the node-hole in the same
relative position.  The mouth is two-ninths in width, and cut up a
fourth of its width.
</blockquote>
<p>Audsley claims that the Zauberfl&ouml;te is of greatest value
at 4' pitch, and indeed that seems to be the most common pitch
(see examples below).  
He provides a description of the last example voiced by
Thynne, also at 4' pitch, in St. John's Church, Richmond, Surrey,
England:</p>

<a href="Zauberflote1.gif"><img src="Zauberflote1$.gif" align=right></a>

<blockquote>
The stop is formed of wood and metal, and its unique and characteristic
feature obtains in the fact that from tenor C to the top note of its
compass the pipes are stopped and harmonic, speaking the first possible
upper partial tone - the Twelfth - of the ground tone belonging to
their speaking length.  The octave of the stop from CC to BB is formed
of open wood pipes, the scale of the CC pipe being 2.13 inches by
2.81 inches.  The mouth of this pipe is 5/8 inch in height, and has a
straight upper lip, about 1/8 inch thick, and slightly rounded.  The
wind-way is narrow; and both cap and block have twenty nicks cut in a
vertical direction.  The cap is set 1/8 inch below the edge of the block.
The mouth is of the ordinary form, sloped externallly, and without
applied ears.  The cap is hollowed and cut to a sharp edge at the
wind-way.<br>
From tenor C to E = 5 notes, the pipes are of wood, stopped, and 
harmonic.  The scale of the C pipe is 2.13 inches by 2.75 inches;
and its length from its lower lip, including sufficient hold for the
stopper, is 2 feet 9 1/2 inches.  It is perforated with a hole, 1/16
inch in diameter, 19 1/4 inches above the lower lip.  In all cases the
holes are made as small as possible, being just sufficient to prevent
the pipes from speaking their ground tone.  The mouth is of the same
form as in the open pipes, and has a straight upper lip about 1/16
inch thick, cut up 7/16 inch.  The cap, which is set flush with the
edge of the block, is sunk on the inside to form the wind-way, and is
sloped externally, to correspond with the mouth, leaving 1/8 inch at
the wind-way.  This treatment, which was used by Schulze in the wood
pipes of his <a href="../o/OpenDiapason.html">Principals</a>, 8 ft.,
allows a free current of air to approach the mouth from below.  In
the Zauberfl&ouml;te this sloping of the cap is slightly rounded,
and not straight like that of the upper lip of the mouth.  Both the
block and cap have twenty-eight fine nicks, cut vertically as in the
open pipes.  The feet of all the wood pipes are of metal so that
exact regulation may be readily accomplished.
<br>
We now come to the metal portion of the stop, which commences on
tenor F and extends to the top note.  The scale of this portion is
best given at the middle c1 pipe.  The internal diameter of this
pipe is 1.91 inches, and its length is 17 inches from the lower lip,
allowing about 1 1/4 inches for the stopper.  The harmonic perforation
is about 1/16 inch in diameter, and is situated at the distance of
9 inches above the languid.  The exact proportions of this pipe are
shown in [the illustration reproduced here].  The width of the mouth
is 1 5/16 inches, and its height is a fraction more than one-fourth
of its width.  The upper lip is straight; and the mouth has small
ears.  The wind-way is of medium size and has twenty-six fine nicks.
All the pipes have cork stoppers mounted on wooden handles.
<br>
The Zauberfl&ouml;te was made by Mr. Thynne of both 8 ft. and 4 ft.
pitch.  When of the former pitch, the bass octave was formed of
stopped wood pipes, voiced to carry down the characteristic tone
of the stop as closely as possible.  The true tone, however, obtains
only in the harmonic range of the stop.

Sumner gives the location of the node hole as two-fifths along
the body.

The accompanying photograph shows a metal Zauberfl&ouml;te with the
caps and node holes clearly visible.  This 2' stop is in the organ
of the Culver Academies Chapel, Indiana, USA, where it is named 
<a href="../p/Piccolo.html">Piccolo</a>.  The photo appears here
courtesy of John Gouwens.  A sound clip is available below.
