It said to possess the great advantage of standing well in tune, a rare virtue indeed among short-length reed-stops! The tone is rather intriguing, being a kind of cross between Krummhorn and Schalmei, of moderate power, yet quietly insistent. Irwin has this to say: A veriety of the Schalmei, at 8' or 4' on manuals and pedals. This short-resonator Reed gives a covered variety of the nasal, somewhat acid, reedy tone quality heard in the Schalmei. Some of the Schalmei's higher overtones are dampened by this form of pipe. This is a very useful color Reed which can be added to either pedal or manual combinations. It lends a distinctive tone quality to any flue stops, but at the same time does not drown out their pitches. Each pipe consists of a short brass tube inserted in the boot, with a cylindrical portion of larger diameter set over each brass tube, the top of the larger pipe being capped. The sound is thus forced from the bottom of the pipe, losing on the way some of the reed's brilliance, but not its pungent, nasal timbre.
