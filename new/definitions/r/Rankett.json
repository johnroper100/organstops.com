While the stop's resonators have been made with a variety of shapes, they are always short, and usually capped with holes in the side or bottom, resulting in a gentle, muffled tone. Wedgwood calls it a variety of Chalumeau, and considers Sordun to be a synonym. Williams dates it from the end of the 16th century \ufffdin the area north of a line Antwerp-Breslau\ufffd, and states that it had lost popularity by the end of the 17th century.
