A few sources equate this stop with the Rauschquinte, but most sources distinguish between them. Grove dates it from the late 16th century, and gives alterate definitions for Rauschwerk. The name appears to derive from the German word rauschen, meaning \ufffdto rustle\ufffd, but Williams considers that unlikely. The rauschpfeife was also a pre-Baroque wind instrument, having a capped reed and loud tone. Williams reports that early examples of the stop were flute or semi-flute Mixtures imitating the instrument.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains over 100 examples of Rauschpfeife, from II to V ranks, the earliest of which are shown below.
