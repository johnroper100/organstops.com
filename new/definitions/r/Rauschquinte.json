Grove reports that these names were not used reliably until recently, and gives alternate definitions for Rauschwerk. A few sources equate these names with the Rauschpfeife, but most sources distinguish between them. Williams reports that early examples of the name Rauschquinte were flute or semi-flute Mixtures imitating a reed instrument. While the names beginning with \ufffdrausch\ufffd appear to derive from the German word rauschen, meaning \ufffdto rustle\ufffd, Williams considers that unlikely.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Grossrauschquinte", "link": "Grossrauschquinte"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains four examples of Quartane, and two of Quarta.
