Carruthers, a famous reed voicer, for many years with the Kimball Company. It had very narrow cylindrical resonators of spotted metal, and had a tone-quality about half way between that of the Krumet and Kinura, being keener than the former, but fuller than the latter. There was an example of this relatively rare stop in the Bagdad Theatre, Portland, Oregon.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Muted Cornet 8', Orchestra; John Wanamaker Store, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Muted Cornet 8', Orchestra; John Wanamaker Store, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
