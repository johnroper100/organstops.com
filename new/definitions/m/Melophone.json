(2) A specialty of the Kimball Organ Co., consisting of a metal cylindrical flue pipe, of Violin Diapason scale, speaking two qualities of unison pitch at one and the same time, viz., String and \ufffdOpen Wood.\ufffd In other words a string-toned Flute. Washington Temple, U.S.A. (Kimball Co.). Maclean describes Kimball's Melophone as a large scale stop of the Melodia type. Irwin gives a different description: A Flute stop of solo quality, at 8' on the manuals, and formed from heavy-walled open metal pipes, sometimes wood. It is quite loud, and sounds as a hybrid between the horn's overtones and an open Flute. Good examples are sympathetic and warm in quality. A few are string-like or even bright. It is also a big-toned ensembled stop, of easy blend with Trumpets or Diapasons. It has a complete train of harmonics since its pipes are inverted-conical and the mouth cut-up is fairly low. It may be heard from the Solo chests of concert or theater organs, and also some church organs. A few examples have belled tops for one-third to one-half their lengths. The wooden ranks are slightly inverted-pyramidal in shape. This stop should not be confused with the Mellophone, a reed stop.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples rae given below.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Melophone 8', Solo; Mormon Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA; Kimball 1901.
