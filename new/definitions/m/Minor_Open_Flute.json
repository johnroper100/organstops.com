It may sound in contrast to a louder Flute on any division. Large unit organs usually make use of the Reed and flue names that they want to duplicate at different dynamic levels by adding Major and Minor to them.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
