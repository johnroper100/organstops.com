A smooth string tone of large scale, lightly blown. It is a predecessor of the more ideal form representing muted strings, the Flute Celeste. Their tone differs but their implications are similar. Skinner lists as synonyms the names Muted Violin and Viole Sourdine, names which have been used for similar stops of different construction.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains five examples of Viole Sourdine, two of which appear to be of the Skinner type.
