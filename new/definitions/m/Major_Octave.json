It is designed to sound with a very loud unison Diapason, such as the Major Diapason. The name Grand Octave is mentioned only in passing by Audsley: \ufffdThe term grand has been applied to other stops for the purpose of indicating their relative importance; we, accordingly, find such terms as ... Grand Octave.\ufffd We can only assume that this name indicates a 4' Grand Diapason, and thus is a synonym for Major Octave.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "No examples of Grand Octave are known.
