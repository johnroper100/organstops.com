This stop is of large scale and loud tone, and may be of wood or metal or both. Irwin describes its tone as brilliant, strong and clear. According to Audsley, one or both of the names Flauto Maggiore and Majorfl\u00f6te have been used for stopped flutes. The name Fl\u00fbte Majeur appears only in Grove, who cites the name in the entry for Flauto, but does not describe it; we assume it to be a synonym for these other names. According to Wedgwood, the name Major Flute has also been used for the Tibia Plena and Flute Double. Wedgwood considers Tibia Major to be a synonym, though other sources disagree.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains nine examples of Flauto Major at 8' pitch, and three at 16', one example of Flauto Maggiore, five of Fl\u00fbte Majeure, and nine examples of Major Flute at 8' pitch, three at 4', and one at 16'.
