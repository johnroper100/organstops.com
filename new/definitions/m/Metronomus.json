As is typical of regals, the resonators are 1/16 length, the longest being 32' long. The cost of the resonators was one factor in this stop's ultimate failure. While little information is available, it is believed to have been an early form of Diaphone. With the frequency of this stop ranging from 1hz (one cycle (thump) per second) in the bass to 6 hz in the so-called treble, it functions very well as a metronome. The stop, along with the entire organ and the church in which it resided, was lost when two of this stop's notes ciphered simultaneously. By a tragic coincidence, the resultant tones were at exactly the resonant frequencies of the sanctuary, which caused the sound to be amplified to the point where the building collapsed.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
