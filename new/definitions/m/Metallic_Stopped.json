It is traditionally reported that the pipes of this instrument were not open to public examination. Bishop, the celebrated organ builder, was so impressed with the tone of these Gedeckts that he endeavored, after careful listening, to imitate it. By dint of much experimenting he succeeded to his satisfaction in doing so. He employed wooden pipes of the ordinary rectangular shape outside, but, above middle C, internally of cylindrical form. When, sometime later, Messrs. Bishop had Schulze's organ through their hands, it was found that the Stopped Metallic was really a very faithful representation of the original Gedeckt tone. Shortly after Bishop's attempt, Schulze enlarged the organ at the Temple Church, London, and in the most liberal manner he permitted other builders to examine his pipes. It was then discovered that his Lieblich Gedeckt, the nearest equivalent to which had hitherto in England been made of wood, was of metal. As it was then found easier to employ metal pipes, the use of the Stopped Metallic was discontinued. The Metallic Flute was a stop, generally of open pipes, voiced on similar lines. . . . The author well remembers a Stopped Metallic of beautifully mellow tone at Brighton College (Bishop). Other examples were inserted at Brompton Oratory, Bombay Cathedral, etc. (Bishop).", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
