It is suitable for both flue and Reed ensembles. Its valvular pipes are a bass extension of a large-scale, thick-walled flue Diapason of metal form. This mechanism was used only in the notes from CCCC to CCC. Thick brass reeds, rather than a Diaphone's pallet, vibrate against a very heavy wooden shallot. The resonators are of thick zinc. It is not now being built, and exists in just a few of this company's organs. It is not clear why Irwin considers this stop to be a form of Diaphone; Diaphones are by definition valvular, and not reed stops.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Magnaton 16', Pedal; Spreckles Organ Pavilion, Balboa Park, San Diego, California, USA; Austin 1915.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Magnaton 16', Pedal; Spreckles Organ Pavilion, Balboa Park, San Diego, California, USA; Austin 1915."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
