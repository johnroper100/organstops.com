Its tone is not so unusual as its name, since it is difficult to find orthodox names in sufficient quantity for a very large organ which may have six or to ten loud Trumpet stops in it. It has all the functions of all of the other loud Chorus Reeds. Sumner lists Trompette militaire with this description: A stop, made by Henry Willis III, with flaring brass tubes, and of very free, loud tone, intended to imitate the tone of the French cavalry trumpets. An example may be heard in the Dome organ at St. Paul's Cathedral.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Trompette Militaire 8', Solo; St. Matthew's Lutheran Church, Hanover, Pennsylvania, USA; Austin 1925-1982.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Trompette Militaire 8', Solo; St. Matthew's Lutheran Church, Hanover, Pennsylvania, USA; Austin 1925-1982."}, {"link": "", "name": "Trompette Militaire 8', Solo; Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Newark, New Jersey, USA; Schantz 1953/1990."}, {"link": "", "name": "Trompette Militaire 8'; St. Paul's Cathedral, London, England; Willis 1936.
