Casparini who was evidently not entirely familiar with current Saxon stop-names. Hence auxiliary stops on German organs imitating the famed G\u00f6rlitz instrument, such as the 4' (pedal), 8' (Unterwerk) and 2' (Hw) stops at K\u00f6nigsberg Cathedral, 1721 (J. Mosengel). Grove concurs, and dates it from 1690-1740. Adlung, however, maintains that these names are simply synonyms for Octave. The stop is named for Jubal, \ufffdthe father of all such as handle the harp and organ\ufffd (Genesis iv.21, KJV).", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "The only known examples are given below.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Jubal 8', Solo; Basilica del Santisimo Sacramento, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Mutin-Cavaille-Coll 1912."}, {"link": "", "name": "Tubal 8', Pedal; St. Michael, Vienna, Austria; Johann David Sieber 1714."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
