The stop, voiced on wind of low pressure, yielded a tone of an extremely refined and delicate character, probably closely resembling that of the Vox Angelica, 8 ft., of today. It was usually and properly made of unison (8 ft.) pitch but an Octave seems to have sometimes been made. Adlung lists Vox Virginea with the following description: Vox virginea, the \ufffdmaiden's voice\ufffd (Jungferstimme), is perhaps identical to the Jungfernregal mentioned above in \u00a7.161. Its voicing must be gentler (lieblicher) than that of the abovementioned Vox humana. It is likely of narrower scale, an octave higher, and also usable only in the upper octaves.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples of Vox Virginea are given below.
