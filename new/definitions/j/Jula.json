Wedgwood defines it as \ufffdan 8 ft., or Quint, Gemshorn; also a corruption of Jubalfl\u00f6te\ufffd. According to Adlung, Jula is usually a Spitzfl\u00f6te of 8' or 6' (5 1/3') pitch. Audsley reports that Schlimbach and Seidel gave this name to the 8' Spitzfl\u00f6te. Williams has the most to say: A rare stop-name with different meanings in German organs: open Quint-major oder Jula to Samber (1707), Spitzflote 8' to Zang (1829), and 8' stop probably open at Rostock Marienkirche (1580s, H. Glovatz), a narrow open Quinte of gentle tone to the author of the Dresdner Handschrift. Samber was probably copying Praetorius (1619). Grove summarizes Williams, and adds: \ufffda soft, narrow mutation (Praetorius)\ufffd.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Julaquinte", "link": "Julaquinte"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples are given below.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Iula 8', Great; Duomo di Cernia, Pisa, Italy; 1710.
