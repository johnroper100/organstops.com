The tone is harmonically full up to approximately the twentieth or twenty-fifth harmonic position, and definitely brass-like, since it has many of the lower harmonics in almost equal loudness. The Tuba Sonora's forceful and big tone is, however, never achieved by this Tuba. This is both a solo and ensemble stop. It is sometimes warm in tone, but never mellow like the Waldhorn. It has nones of the horn quality of the French Horn. It has practically no clang-tone. It is free from dissonance and that assertive manner of speaking heard in most of the Tuba tribe. It has none of the Tuba Horn quality of the theater organ. Its partly capped tubes are small compared to average Tuba scale.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Tuba d'Amour 16', 8', 4', Echo; Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA; Midmer-Losh 1929-32.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Tuba d'Amour 16', 8', 4', Echo; Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA; Midmer-Losh 1929-32."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
