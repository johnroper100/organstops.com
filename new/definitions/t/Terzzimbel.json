It was known as early as the late 15th century, was recommended by Praetorius, and was popular among northern Dutch builders. Williams writes: \ufffdThe old Terzzimbeln were used in both solo and chordal passages, and probably so were Schnitger's. Strictly speaking, however, the chorus function of the old Terzzimbel had been taken over by the Zimbel proper, which was a third-less, constantly breaking high Mixture. Williams suggests that the Terzzimbel was a precursor to the Terzian.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains over three dozen examples, all but a handful are of III ranks.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Tertscymbel, Stoel (rugpositief); St. Niklaaskerk, Gent, Belgium; Niclays 1605.
