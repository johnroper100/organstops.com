There is no theoretical or practical reason why this low pedal flue should not prove useful, except, perhaps, slowness of speech. The organ-building world would seem to disagree with Irwin, as there are only two true 64' stops in existence, one being a Contra Trombone (Town Hall, Sydney, Australia), the other being the a Diaphone Profundo (Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA).", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
