The third harmonic is also audible, though much softer. This stop was invented by Hope-Jones and placed in the organ of Worcester Cathedral, England in 1897, and voiced by J. W. Whiteley. Irwin claims its scale to be moderate; other sources report its scale to be small or very small. Wedgwood describes its construction as stopped tin pipes with small bores and windways. Each pipe has a beard and \ufffda sort of shade projecting over the top of the mouth\ufffd. According to Bonavia-Hunt, each pipe has a roller bridge to \ufffdlock\ufffd the fundamental. It was difficult to keep regulated. The name Tiercina has also been used at least once for a stop of 3-1/5' pitch (see below).", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Tiercina 8', Choir; Worcestor Cathedral, Worcestor, England; Hope-Jones 1896.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Tiercina 8', Choir; Worcestor Cathedral, Worcestor, England; Hope-Jones 1896."}, {"link": "", "name": "Tiercina 8', Third Organ, String Sub-division; Festival Hall, Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St. Louis, Missouri, USA; Art Organ Co.
