Like many Spanish reeds, the Trompeta Bastarda was often mounted en chamade. The Spanish word bastarda means a piece of ordnance (i.e. a cannon). Trompeta Recordata is mentioned only by Maclean, who describes it only as an 8' Trumpet with half-length resonators. Without further information, we assume it to be synonymous with Trompeta Bastarda. Its etymology is not known.

While Osiris lists it at 8', a different source lists it at 4', though this may have been based on the resonator length rather than the speaking pitch."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
