{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Tromba", "origin": "Italian", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "The name Tromba was first used by Italian organ builders for Trumpet stops. In the 18th century German and English builders began using the name for a chorus reed whose tone was midway between that of the Trumpet and the Tuba: smoother, broader, and less brassy than the Trumpet, but not as powerful as the Tuba. It was favored by Harrison & Harrison for their Great divisions. The name has also been used for an 8' extension of a 16' pedal Trombone. Audsley claims that the name was also used by Spanish and Portuguese builders, but we know of no examples.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains about 120 examples, six at 16' pitch, one at 4', one at 64', and the rest at 8'.
