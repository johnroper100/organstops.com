The organ stop, supposedly imitative of the instrument, has been made in four varieties: (1) A rare German reed stop of the 17th and 18th centuries, described by Grove as \ufffda distinct type, i.e. a gentle 16' tone\ufffd. According to Maclean, it was made by builders such as Casparini, Engler, and Mosengel. (2) A Spanish reed with short resonators, called \ufffdmore familiar\ufffd by Grove and \ufffdmore important\ufffd by Williams, dating from around 1750 and often found en chamade. Maclean puts it at 16' or 8' pitch, on the treble half of the split Spanish manual. (3) According to Williams, \ufffda string stop similar to the other narrow flue ranks popular at the end of the 18th cent.\ufffd (4) A mixture of II or III ranks. While not mentioned in the literature, most of the known examples are of this variety.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "No examples of the names Theorbo or Tiorba are known.
