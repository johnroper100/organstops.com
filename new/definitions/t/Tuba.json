While some authorities describe this chorus reed as a large-scaled Trumpet, others characterize its tone as being more \ufffdclosed\ufffd than that of the Trumpet. Indeed, Bonavia-Hunt states that some Tubas are close-toned, while others are free-toned in the French manner. The closed-toned variety was developed in England, first introduced in 1825 under the name Ophicleide by William Hill, and later perfected by Henry Willis. The tone of the Tuba depends on a relatively high wind pressure, not merely to produce sheer volume, but to develop the smoothness of tone that characterizes the best examples of this stop. A minimum of 8\" to 10\" of wind is required, and higher pressures are common. It is constructed in the manner of a large-scale Trumpet, though often with closed shallots. Double-length resonators are often used, even triple-length in the treble (see Harmonic Tuba). It is most commonly found at 8' pitch.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Bass Tuba", "link": "BassTuba"}, {"name": "Contra Tuba", "link": "BassTuba"}, {"name": "Double Tuba", "link": "BassTuba"}, {"name": "Harmonic Tuba", "link": "HarmonicTuba"}, {"name": "Octave Tuba", "link": "TubaClarion"}, {"name": "Orchestral Tuba", "link": "OrchTuba"}, {"name": "Solo Tuba", "link": "SoloTuba"}, {"name": "Tuba Clarion", "link": "TubaClarion"}, {"name": "Tuba d'Amour", "link": "TubaDAmour"}, {"name": "Tuba Harmonic", "link": "HarmonicTuba"}, {"name": "Tuba Horn", "link": "BassHorn"}, {"name": "Tuba Imperial", "link": "TubaMirabilis"}, {"name": "Tuba Magna", "link": "TubaMirabilis"}, {"name": "Tuba Major", "link": "TubaMirabilis"}, {"name": "Tuba Minor", "link": "TubaMinor"}, {"name": "Tuba Mirabilis", "link": "TubaMirabilis"}, {"name": "Tuba Profunda", "link": "BassTuba"}, {"name": "Tuba Profundissima", "link": "TubaProfundissima"}, {"name": "Tuba Quint", "link": "TubaQuint"}, {"name": "Tuba Shofar", "link": "TubaShofar"}, {"name": "Tuba Sonora", "link": "TubaSonora"}, {"name": "Tuba Trumpet", "link": "TubaTrumpet"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains about 130 examples of Tuba (not counting its variants).
