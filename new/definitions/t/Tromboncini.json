Tromboncini were very small-scale regals, often of wood, sometimes brass or pewter funnel-shaped resonators; in Venetian organs of the 18th cent. they were placed vertically in front of the Case-pipes or Principale, or in the lower storey of the instrument near to the organist. The resonators could be small, narrow, square, wooden pipes with a smaller metal flaring cap at the top (S. Teresa, Venice, 1772; Angelo Raffaele, Venice, 1749). The rank was usually halved, to allow soft r.h. or l.h. solos; very useful tone-colour in the small Venetian scheme.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Tromboncini 16' (regal), Positiv; Passau Cathedral, Bavaria, Germany; Steinmeyer 1924.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Tromboncini 16' (regal), Positiv; Passau Cathedral, Bavaria, Germany; Steinmeyer 1924."}, {"link": "", "name": "Tromboncini 4', Pedal (extension of Tromba?); Columbus Hospital Chapel, Chicago, Illinois, USA; Tamburini."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
