In the pedal, they may be at 3-1/5' and 2-2/3' to reinforce the 16' harmonic series. A third rank is sometimes added: 2' + 1-3/5' + 1-1/3' or 4' + 3-1/5' + 2-2/3'. The stop is usually made without breaks in the ranks, but many examples do break back an octave at c'. According to Grove, the ranks were scaled somewhat wider than the Principal. Williams dates it from the 17th and 18th centuries in Holland and northwest Germany, and says \ufffda Tertian on one manual and Sesquialtera on another was a characteristic and important element in a well-balanced organ of Schnitger's type\ufffd.
