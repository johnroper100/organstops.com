Its pitch is 2/5' when reinforcing the 8' harmonic series, and 4/5' when reinforcing the 16' harmonic series. Irwin claims that this rank sounds \ufffdfour octaves and a third above the keys depressed ... at the approximate pitch of the twentieth harmonic\ufffd. Irwin has it backwards. This rank, if it is to be of any use at all, must sound at exactly the 20th harmonic, which is only approximately four octaves and a third above the fundamental.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
