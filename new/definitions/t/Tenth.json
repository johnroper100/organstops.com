It is a third-sounding rank, supporting the fifth harmonic, and sounds an octave below the Seventeenth. Its pipes are usually open, but may be stopped. According to Grove, it was first known in France around 1660; Williams cites a 1660 organ by Enocq at Les Jacobins, Paris, France as possibly the first to contains such a stop. Hopkins & Rimbault state that this stop was first introduced in England at the Mechanics' Institution in Liverpool. Bedos, writing in the mid-1700's, describes the Grosse Tierce as a wide-scale (flute) mutation of full manual compass which never appears in the Positif, but sometimes appears in the Pedale. While the names Decem and Decima mean \"tenth\", they have also been used as synonyms for Seventeenth (Tierce), as has Decupla. The name Grosse Tierce has been used for a wide-scaled Tierce to distinguish it from a narrow-scaled Petite Tierce. Terz is also a synonym for Tierce and Third.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Terzbass, Terzenbass", "link": "Terzbass"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains 58 examples of Gross[e] Tierce, 13 examples of Tenth, 11 examples of Grossterz, 3 examples of Double Tierce, and 1 example of Decima.
