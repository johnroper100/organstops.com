It sounds the 10th harmonic, at 4/5' for the 8' harmonic series, or 1-3/5' for the 16' harmonic series. It is a third-sounding rank. Irwin claims: \ufffdit approximates the tenth natural harmonic ... and sounds the E4 from middle C\ufffd. Irwin is wrong. It speaks exactly the 10th harmonic, which only approximates an E when played from a C key.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "No examples of Vigesima Quarta or Vigessima-quarta are known.
