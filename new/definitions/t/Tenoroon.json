Wedgwood and Audsley report that it was some sort of Bourdon, used in the middle of the century; Hopkins & Rimbault describe it as a Double Open Diapason. Grove says that it was used in the early part of the century, and indicated either a flue or a reed. Sumner and Maclean say that its name was derived from the orchestral instrument of the same name, but later used for flue stops as well, and occasionally for a Diapason. Audsley, on the other hand, maintains that the name had nothing to do with the orchestral instrument. The orchestral tenoroon, invented in the first half of the 19th century, was a small bassoon pitched a fifth above the normal bassoon. The name Teneroon is used only by Sumner.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples given below.
