These stops are said to be of wood and of a soft viol quality of tone. The name would seem to imply the presence, in some prominence, of the fourth upper partial tone - the Seventeenth - in the voices of the stops, quite compatible with good viol-tone. Wedgwood lists it as \ufffda sweet and soft-toned Gamba\ufffd, and cites the same example as Audsley.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
