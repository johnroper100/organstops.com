It represents the lowest non-unison pitch that reinforces a harmonic of the fundamental pitch (8' on the manuals, 16' on the pedals). As such, it is the most important mutation pitch. It serves to bind together the 8' and 4' tones in a Principal chorus. This stop is usually constructed of open cylindrical metal pipes yielding Diapason tone, usually and properly of smaller scale than the 4' Octave of the same division. Other forms and tones are used, especially conical pipes. On the theatre organ, the 2-2/3' pitch is taken from the Tibia Clausa or Concert Flute. The name Quint is more properly a synonym for Fifth The name Nasard and its variants are often used as synonyms for Twelfth, but they are more properly of flute tone.
