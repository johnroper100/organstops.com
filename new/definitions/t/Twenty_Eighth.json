These pitches sound at the notes three octaves and a flatted seventh above the keys struck, which is at Bb4 from middle C, and Bb1 from low pedal CCC. It is best identified as the octave of the well-known Septi\u00e8me. It is a mixture rank in a few cases, speaking in the lower octaves where the Septi\u00e8me might be too low in pitch. It is never a separate stop knob. This rank reinforces the 14th harmonic. In an equally tempered instrument, that harmonic will only approximate a Bb in pitch.
