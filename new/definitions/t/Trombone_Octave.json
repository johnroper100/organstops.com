It would be difficult to overrate the importance of such a combination of lingual stops at the disposal of the organist; yet it has never appeared in any executed Organ. Audsley published his stop dictionary in 1921. In the decades following, Frederick C. Mayer, organist and choirmaster at the Cadet Chapel, United States Military Academy, West Point, New York, USA, expanded the organ there based on Audsley's concepts. Today it includes Trombones in the Chancel Pedal at 10-2/3', 5-1/3', 4', 3-1/5', 2-2/3', and 2', and in the Harmonic division at 5-1/3', 3-1/5', 2-2/3', and 1-3/5'.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
