{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Tromba Quint", "origin": "Italian?", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Listed only by Irwin, who says: A powerful and assertive Quint of brass tone, at 5-1/3' on the manuals, and rarely in the pedals. It belongs to the sub-unison series of stops, and should always be drawn with a loud Reed of 16' pitch. It is less assertive and prominent in tone than the Trompette Quint or Bombarde Quinte, also of this pitch. Since it speaks but five notes above the unison 8' pitch, it should be drawn with caution. Its whole train of brassy overtones must be assimilated by the 16', and perhaps 8' and 4' stops, to make it sound in balance. It is only on large organs.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Tromba Quint 10-2/3', Pedal; Memorial Auditorium, Worcestor, Massachusetts, USA; Kimball 1933.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Tromba Quint 10-2/3', Pedal; Memorial Auditorium, Worcestor, Massachusetts, USA; Kimball 1933."}, {"link": "", "name": "Tromba Quint 10-2/3', Fanfare, Pedal (left gallery); Tromba Quint 5-1/3', Brass Chorus; Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA; Midmer-Losh 1929-32."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
