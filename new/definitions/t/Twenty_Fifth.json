It sounds from middle C at F4, and from the pedal low CCC key at F1. The 8/11' is between the 4/5' and 2/3' pitches, but, unlike these, it is not an orthodox mixture constituent. It has been heard in a few unusual Cymbals. It very roughly corroborates the eleventh harmonic of the unisons. It lends a very brassy brilliance and unusual timbre to any loud combination. Irwin is not quite correct; notwithstanding the name Twenty-Fifth, a stop of 8/11' pitch should exactly corroborate the eleventh harmonic of the 8' series, and sound only approximately an F when played from a C key on an equal-tempered instrument. The name Undezime is not mentioned in the literature; we assume it to be a synonym.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples are given below.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Twenty-Fifth 8/11', Choir-Swell; Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey; Midmer-Losh 1929-32."}, {"link": "", "name": "Undezime 8/11'; Nikolaikirche, Siegen, Germany; Kemper 1955."}, {"link": "", "name": "Undezime 8/11'; Dreifaltigskirche, Kaufbeuren, Germany; Schmid 1964."}, {"link": "", "name": "Undecime 8/11'; Dominikanerkirche, Landshut, Germany; Schmid 1966."}, {"link": "", "name": "Undezime 8/11'; St. Anna, Alt\u00f6tting, Germany; Schmid 1976."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
