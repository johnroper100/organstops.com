The reeds were furnished with slender resonators, introducing the proper construction of free-reeds stops. Availing himself of the fact that free-reeds can produce varied strengths of tone under different pressures of wind without alteration of pitch, the organ-builder arranged to impart powers of expression to the Terpomele by means of a contrivance placed under the control of the organist. Wedgwood also lists it, saying: A free-reed stop inserted at Beauvais Cathedral (1827-29). The pipes were of Euphone shape. The wind pressure was variable at the option of the player, and the stop, therefore, open to expressive use.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
