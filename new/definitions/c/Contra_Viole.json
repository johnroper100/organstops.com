In most examples this is a TC stop, which means that the pipes go down to Tenor C; the bottom 16' octave is non-existent. However, a few instruments have examples where the pipes continue all the way down to 16' C. In these instruments, the stop appears in the pedal division. Some rare examples even have a matching celeste that goes all the way down to bottom 16' C.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains ten examples of Contra Viole, none of which are in theatre organs, and thus are more likely to be synonyms for Contre Viole.
