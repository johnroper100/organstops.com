We call this new stop \"Cantus Flute,\" as it is designed to play cantus melodies in the pedal. It is a 4' Open Wood Flute, useful for Baroque chorales with alto melodies in pedal, but we were more thinking of flute melodies such as in the 4th movement of the Widor V or the variation in the Durufl\ufffd Veni Creator. Scale is 2.25\" x 2.58\" (inside dimension), inverted mouths, wood pipes 1-32, tuning flaps on all pipes.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples are listed below.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Cantus Flute 4', Pedal; West End United Methodist Church, Nashville, Tennessee, USA; Moller 1983.
