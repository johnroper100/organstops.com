In a few cases it has been given its own manual on an organ, with mechanical linkages between the keys and the hammers. It is usually of short compass, sometimes little more than an octave. It was, according to Williams, not uncommon in 18th century south and central Germany. Some sources equate this stop with the Glockenspiel. The photograph shows part of a Chimes stop with electric action; click on it for a larger image. According to Williams, the name Campanello was used for struck bells in organs by C. Serassi in the first half of the 19th century. That name has also been used as a synonym for Glockenspiel and Campana. There is also a mixture stop which goes by the name Carillon.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains over 200 examples of Chimes, and 60 examples of Carillon, of which just under half are of the percussion variety (the others are mixtures).", "examples": [], "soundClips": [{"divisionName": "", "clips": [{"files": [{"name": "Arpeggio", "file": "ChimesArpegHiLow.mp3"}, {"name": "St. Anne", "file": "ChimesStAnneSolo.mp3"}], "name": "Chimes, Swell", "organLink": "CulverAcademy", "organName": "Culver Academies, Indiana, USA", "organBuilderName": "Fabry 1982-85; Deagan tubes"}]}], "bibliography": []}
