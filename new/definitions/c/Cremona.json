In the past, some organ builders have incorrectly interpreted it as indicating a violin, after the Italian city of Cremona, famed for its violins. Irwin claims that the name has also been used as a synonym for Clarinet Flute. Grove dates the name from around 1680, which predates the introduction of the name Clarinet by half a century.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains 37 examples, all at 8' pitch except for two at 4'.
