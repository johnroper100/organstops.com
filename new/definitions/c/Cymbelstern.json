When the stop is engaged, the star rotates, producing a continuous tinkling sound. The star was often visible on the exterior of the organ case; when not visible, it may or may not have a star shape. It was common in northern Europe, Germany in particular, throughout the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. Williams suggests it was introduced 1585-8 at M\u00fcnster Cathedral by Lampeler van Mill, though Osiris contains at least one older example (see below). After 1700 the bells were sometimes tuned to particular notes. The name Zymbelstern means \ufffdcymbal star\ufffd, Akkordglocken means \ufffdchord bells\ufffd, and \u00c9toile Sonore means \ufffdringing star\ufffd. The name Clochette[s] is mentioned only by Wedgwood, who carelessly lists it as a synonym for Carillon, Glockenspiel and Gongs, without any further discussion of the name. We find ten examples of it in Osiris, four of which are mixtures (see Jeu de Clochette); the other six appear to be percussion stops, but it is not known whether they are of the Zimbelstern type. According to Adlung, the names Cymbel and Timpani have been used for this stop, but Cymbel usually indicates a mixture, and Timpani is usually a percussion.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Variations on the German name Zymbelstern are very common; Osiris contains over 200 examples, and the oldest known example is given below.
