Anneessens, we found a free-red stop labeled Clarinet \u00e0 Pavillon, the resonators of which are in the form of short inverted cones surmounted by shorter cylindrical pieces upon which are fitted regulating slides, shaded with partly-attached metal discs in the usual fashion. In one of the pipes we measured the conical body of the resonator is 4 7/8 inches long, having a diameter at its cylindrical adjunct of 2 inches. This adjunct and the regulating slide measure 1 inch in height. The entire resonator has, accordingly, a speaking length of about 6 inches. The tone of this stop is pleasing but not a satisfactory imitation of the orchestral Clarinet; on the contrary, it inclines to the tone one attributes to the Musette. The name is somewhat of a mystery; the term pavillon usually indicates a \ufffdbell\ufffd, or inverted-conical section at the top of a pipe or resonator.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
