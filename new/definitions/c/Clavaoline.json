(Wedgwood and Audsley give the year as 1830; Grove says around 1820.) As introduced by its inventor, it had nickel silver tongues mounted in small blocks of wood that sat on top of the windchest, and unlike the Physharmonika, had no means of expression. While both Wedgwood and Audsley report that this stop, as made by its inventor, had no resonators, but Williams states (and Grove implies) that it frequently had wooden resonators. According to Wedgwood, the stop has also been made using bell-shaped resonators.
