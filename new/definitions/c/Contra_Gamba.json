According to Hopkins & Rimbault, it was frequently used by Henry Willis. Irwin describes its tone as \ufffdrich, brilliant, but not especially loud\ufffd; Audsley calls it \ufffdstring-like ... but not so pronounced as to be imitative\ufffd. According to Audsley, it is constructed from cylindrical open metal pipes of medium scale. The name Contre Gambe does not appear in the literature, but we assume it to be a synonym.
