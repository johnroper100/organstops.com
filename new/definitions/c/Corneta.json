Used only in Cornet-like registrations (cf. Spanish Nasardos). Cornetto Primo might = Tierce, Cornetto Secondo = Nasard, Cornetto Terzo = Flute 2'; or Primo = 4' + 2-2/3', Secondo 2' + 1-3/5' (Bonatti); together they made a full Cornet. Williams's definition is supported by Grove, who also defines Corneta as a Spanish synonym for Cornet, and lists it as an 18th century Italian synonym for Tierce. Regarding the Spanish Corneta, Williams says: \ufffdusually of more ranks than V in the larger organs; gentler in tone than the French Cornet, being necessary neither for frequent solos nor for boosting the reed trebles.\ufffd Wedgwood lists Cornetto as a synonym for Zink. The Italian word corn\u00e9tta and the Spanish word corneta both mean \ufffdcornet\ufffd. The Italian word corn\u00e9tto means \ufffdlittle horn\ufffd.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains nearly 100 examples of Corneta (not counting variations on that name such as Corneta Clara). Most of them are clearly compound stops; twenty of them have no rank or pitch indication and appear in Spanish organs, but the placement of each stop in its stoplist implies that they are also compound stops. Three are apparently reeds, all of which appear in the organs of the New Cathedral, Salamanca, Spain. Osiris contains about seventeen examples of Cornetto, all of which are compound stops.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Corneta 8', Organo Mayor (right); New Cathedral, Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain; Echevarr\u00eda 1744."}, {"link": "", "name": "Cornetto III-IV, Manual I; Morelia Cathedral, Michoacan, Mexico; Walcker/Tamburini 1905/1960."}, {"link": "", "name": "Cornetto IV, Manual I; Tuomiokirkko, Tampere, Finland; Walcker/Kangasala 1907/1929."}, {"link": "", "name": "Cornetto (discant) III (3, 2 & 1-3/5), Great; Duke University Memorial Chapel, Durham, North Carolina; Brombaugh 1997."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
