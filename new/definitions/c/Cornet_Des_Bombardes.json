It is designed as a supplement to some particular division of loud Chorus Reeds or flue stops, such as the Solo, Fanfare, or Stentor. Pitches above 1-3/5' or 1-1/3' are sometimes broken back in spite of the rule to carry Cornet ranks upward without breaks in pitch. Stentor Cornet or just Harmonics are also usable names. According to Greek legend, Stentor was a herald in the Trojan war, described by Homer as having a voice as loud as fifty men. The word Bombardes here most likely refers to a division; see Bombarde. There is an alternate definition for the name Harmonics.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "No examples of Stentor Cornet are known.
