What it is seems rather obscure. I believe that it is an ordinary Regal which, when it is drawn, causes a repeating Cymbel, which stands on the same toeboard as the Regal, to be heard at the same time. Audsley calls it \ufffdan obsolete lingual stop, of either 4 ft. or 2 ft. pitch; the tone of which was of a metallic and ringing character.\ufffd Mahrenholz provides the most complete description: This stop was completely forgotten for a long time. It is a very appealing stop and the only known mixture made of lingual pipes. On my suggestion, this stop was recently built again by the organ-builder J. Klais, Bonn (Germany), in the organ of the Blinds\ufffd sanatorium at D\ufffdren (Germany). It can have one or two ranks. This is the suggested repetition scheme, C 1/2' + 1', c\ufffd 1' + 2', c1 2' + 4', c2 4' + 8', c3 8' + 8'. The only old example of this stop known to me is in the Gr\u00fcningen castle organ. It was a regal with one rank, at C with the 2' pitch, and it repeated into 4' probably at c'' and into 8' probably at c1.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "The only known examples are those mentioned above.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
