For example, if one pipe speaks approximately middle C at 256 hz, and another pipe speaks at 254 hz, a wavering of 2 beats per second will be heard when they speak together. This \ufffdbeating\ufffd results from the interference of the two sound waves, alternately reinforcing each other and cancelling each other out. (This principle is also used by the Resultant, but for a rather different effect.) The term celeste refers to a rank of pipes detuned slightly so as to produce this effect when combined with a normally tuned rank. It is also used to refer to a compound stop of two or more ranks in which at the ranks are detuned relative to each other. Rarely, a single rank of pipes can be made to produce a celeste all by itself; see Bifara and Ludwigtone. The name Celeste, which in French means \ufffdheavenly\ufffd or \ufffdcelestial\ufffd, is occasionally used by itself in a stoplist, but more often it is used as a modifier of some other name (see Variants listed below). On the other hand, the name Schwebung, a German word meaning \ufffdbeat\ufffd, is usually found alone. (It is also used to refer to a tremulant.) While most celeste stops include the word \ufffdceleste\ufffd, not all of them do. Audsley defines the name Celeste as indicating a small-scaled sharp celeste of string tone, but in actual usage the name can be used for a celeste of nearly any tone quality.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Nearly every organ of any size has at least one celeste, and many very small organs as well. Osiris contains about 120 examples of the unqualified name Celeste.
