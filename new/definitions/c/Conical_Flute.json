This medium to large scale spotted metal rank sounds with a noticeable fundamental and a strong chord of lower-pitched (easier-to-hear) partials down near the fundamental. The fringe of brightness typical of a cylindrical pipe is removed by this pipe-shape. In the bass range this is a tone-builder; in the high treble it is clean and bell-like; in the middle range it is an ideal Copula, accompaniment Flute, and inconspicuous support for any flue combination. It is not a colorful Flute, but an ideal adjunct for other flues. Irwin lists Fl\u00fbte Conique as a synonym, and Maclean writes: In modern English and American usage, the Fl\u00fbte Conique is practically identical with Spitzfl\u00f6te, although perhaps a shade flutier in quality. There is, however, a different stop that goes by the name Fl\u00fbte Conique.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples of Conical Flute are given below.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Conical Flute 2', Pedal; West End United Methodist Church, Nashville, Tennessee, USA; Moller 1983."}, {"link": "", "name": "Conical Flute 4', Manuals I & II; Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Provo, Utah, USA; Bigelow 1987."}, {"link": "", "name": "Conical Flute 4', Great; Victory Lutheran Church, Mesa, Arizona, USA; Bigelow 1988."}, {"link": "", "name": "Conical Flute 4', Great; St. John Vianney Catholic Church, Hacienda Heights, California, USA; Bigelow 1992."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
