It would appear, in this connection, to be applied to the bas extending downward the tone of the Hautbois, which would properly be of Bassoon quality, and, accordingly would be furnished by Bassoon pipes from CC to A, almost two octaves. Wedgwood also lists it with much the same description, using considerably fewer words. A note in the Osiris[1] listing for St.-Denis reads: Cor d'harmonie seems a rare stop from early in Cavaill\u00e9-Coll's career. One is extant at the Chapelle Royale, Dreux, 1845: a reed with half-length resonators with a pierced double-cone at the top, reminiscent of Dom Bedos' Basson.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Cor d'Harmonie 8' (?), Positif; Royal Church, St.-Denis, France; Cavaill\u00e9-Coll.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Cor d'Harmonie 8' (?), Positif; Royal Church, St.-Denis, France; Cavaill\u00e9-Coll."}, {"link": "", "name": "Cor d'Harmonie 4', Solo; Basilica del Santisimo Sacramento, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Mutin-Cavaill\u00e9-Coll 1912.
