The prefix \ufffdChoral\ufffd was used for other stops intended for the same use, including Choralfl\u00f6te. Most sources also list Choralbass as appearing at 2' or even 1' pitch, and according to Grove and Audsley it appeared at 8' or 4' pitch in the manuals, but such stops are rare. Grove and Williams date it from 17th century Germany, but describe it as a flute (as does Maclean), which does not match most modern usage. While Audsley lists Choralbasset as a synonym for Choralbass, and Irwin implies as much, Wedgwood claims Choralbasset is a synonym for Bauerfl\u00f6te.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "The name Choralbass is very common; Osiris contains about 300 examples, appearing in one out of every six organs.
