{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Clear Flute", "origin": "English", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "An open wooden flute of 4' pitch, invented by Kirtland & Jardine of Manchester, England. Its unimitative tone is described by Audsley as \ufffdfull and clear\ufffd, and \ufffdwithout any particular charm or good mixing quality\ufffd. Wedgwood describes it as \ufffdclear, dour and hooting\ufffd, and states that it \ufffdscarcely blends well\ufffd, but Irwin describes it as an ensemble flute, similar to the Hohlfl\u00f6te. Each pipe has an inverted mouth located on the narrow side, cut up anywhere from 1/3 to 2/5, a German (sloped) block containing the windway, and a flat cap. The pipes are copiously winded, and Hopkins & Rimbault report that they are not nicked at all. Wedgwood gives a scale of 3 1/8\" x 2 5/8\" at CC (4'); Audsley gives a scale of 2 1/8\" x 2 1/2\" for the same pipe. Irwin claims that it is sometimes made of metal rather than wood. While some sources list this name as synonymous with Hellfl\u00f6te, they are different stops.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "We know of only four examples:", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Clear Flute 4', Swell; Town Hall, Adelaide, Australia; Walker 1990."}, {"link": "", "name": "Clear Flute 8', Ethereal; John Wanamaker Store, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"link": "", "name": "Clear Flute 4', Pedal; Blackstone residence, location unknown; 1988-95.
