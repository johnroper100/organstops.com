To serve that purpose, a wide variety of constructions and tones have been used. The earliest examples, according to Grove and Williams, were open flue stops: Principals, Gemshorns or Spillfl\u00f6ten. In Habsburg Europe (16th, 17th & 18th centuries, esp. Austria and Germany) it was a stopped flute, essentially a Gedeckt, at 16', 8' and 4' pitches. At various times and places this stop has also been a mutation or a Mixture of two or three ranks. The function of the Coppel is often provided by stops of other names.
