Half of the known examples, however, are pedal reeds of 4' pitch. As a 2' manual stop, the reed pipes rarely extend higher than C37, after which the stop is carried on with flue pipes of similar intonation, or else the stop breaks back an octave at C37 and again at C49.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples are listed below.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Clairon-Doublette 2', Grand Choeur; St. Sulpice, Paris, France; Cavaill\u00e9-Coll 1862."}, {"link": "", "name": "Clairon-Doublette 2', Grand Orgue; Saint-Sernin, Toulouse, France; Cavaill\u00e9-Coll 1889."}, {"link": "", "name": "Clairon-Doublette 2', Pedale; Louise M.
