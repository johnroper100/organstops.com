Its tone is horn-like in the tenor range, and flute-like in the treble; Wedgwood calls it \ufffdextremely beautiful and mellow\ufffd, and likens it to the Dolce and Flute d'Amour. According to Bonavia-Hunt, it was an accompanimental voice used in place of the usual Dulciana or Dolce. The pipes are metal, having inverted languids without nicks, and arched upper lips that are left unbevelled and slightly rounded (i.e. not flattened). Wedgwood and Bonavia-Hunt give a scale at middle C of 1 1/2\", with a one-fifth wide mouth, cut up 7/16\" and speaking on 4\" of wind. Irwin claims that it is sometimes made of metal, and that the pipes are flared slightly at the top. A totally different stop also goes by the name Corno Flute.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples are given below.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Corno Flute 8', Great; Town Hall, Wellington, New Zealand; Norman & Beard 1906 (restored 1986)."}, {"link": "", "name": "Corno Flute 8', Great; Winchester College Chapel, Winchester, England; Norman & Beard 1908 (dismantled 1982)."}, {"link": "", "name": "Corno Flute 8', Great; Christchurch Cathedral, Christchurch, New Zealand; Hill 1880, Norman & Beard 1926."}, {"link": "", "name": "Corno Flute 8', Choir; Town Hall, Melbourne, Australia; Hill, Norman & Beard 1929."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
