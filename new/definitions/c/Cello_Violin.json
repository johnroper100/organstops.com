Its timbre resembles the keen, brilliant Viol as well as the big-toned, pervading timbre of the 'Cello. It forms, like other String stops, a c\u00e9leste. It is a solo as well as an ensemble tone, most useful on the String or Swell Organ. If extended into the bass, it makes a keen, penetrating pedal stop brighter than the Violone.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
