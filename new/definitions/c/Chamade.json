During the 20th century the phrase en chamade came to mean a stop (invariably a loud chorus reed) whose pipes were mounted horizontally outside the organ case. The earliest documented example of external horizontal reeds is in the 1588 organ by Gaspar Martin in the Cathedral of Huesca, Spain. By the 18th century, such placement of reeds was commonplace in Spain and Portugal. In addition to chorus reeds like the Trompeta and Clar\u00edn, other stops could be found mounted in this manner, including Bajoncillo, Chirim\u00eda, and Dulzaina. All of these reeds spoke on low wind pressure, and were not designed to produce an overpowering volume of sound.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Bombarde en Chamade", "link": "BombardeEnChamade"}, {"name": "Clairon en Chamade", "link": "ClaironEnChamade"}, {"name": "Trompette en Chamade", "link": "TrompetteEnChamade"}, {"name": "Fan Trumpet", "link": "TrompetteEnChamade"}, {"name": "Fan Tuba", "link": "FanTuba"}, {"name": "Horizontal Trumpet", "link": "TrompetteEnChamade"}, {"name": "Horizontal Tuba", "link": "FanTuba"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris lists about two dozen organs containing stops named simply Chamade, ranging in pitch from 16' to 2'.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Chamade 8', Hauptwerk; Stadtkirche St. Peter und Paul (Herderkirche), Weimar, Germany; Walcker 1908.
