The name was suggested by the form of the resonators employed, just as in the case of the Fl\u00fbte \u00e0 Pavillon, the pipes of which are surmounted by bells. Another example exists in the Organ in the Church of Saint Vincent de Paul, Paris [France]. Maclean describes it as \ufffda narrow-scaled stop of Trumpet tone\ufffd, and cites the St. Denis example.
