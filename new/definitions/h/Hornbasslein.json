The stop is represented in the Pedal Organ of Walcker's instrument in the Cathedral of St. Stephen, Vienna, under the name Octavbass, 2 ft. While stops of this high pitch are common in German Pedal Organs, they are practically unknown as independent stops in French, English, and American Pedal Organs. They should, however, appear in both the full Compensating Mixture, and the Pedal Grand Cornet. Hornb\u00e4sslein was also known to Praetorius.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains dozens of examples of Octavbass, nearly all at 8' and 4' pitch, implying that a more common use of the name may be for an Octav appearing in the pedal division.
