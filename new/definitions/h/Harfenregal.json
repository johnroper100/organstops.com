Williams gives it very small resonators and a \ufffddelicate string-tone\ufffd; Audsley reports that it was \ufffdsoft-toned\ufffd. Wedgwood lists it at 8' pitch. Adlung calls Harfenregal \ufffda separate type of Regal\ufffd, but does not explain why. A clue may be inferred from the following statement from his entry for Regal: Because this Regal [meaning the type of Regals described in his Regal entry] is blown by wind, it is called Regale a vent, from ventus, \ufffdthe wind\ufffd, and is to be distinguished from Regale de percussion, which is struck with mallets like a xylophone (Strohfiedel); see Mattheson's [Forschende] Orchestre III, Part I, Chap. IV, \ufffd.16, in note [9] on p. 434.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Harfenregal 8', Great; Christ Church Episcopal, Tacoma, Washington, USA; Brombaugh 1979.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Harfenregal 8', Great; Christ Church Episcopal, Tacoma, Washington, USA; Brombaugh 1979."}, {"link": "", "name": "Harfenregal 8', Positiv; Lawrence University Chapel, Appleton, Wisconsin, USA; Brombaugh 1995."}, {"link": "", "name": "Harfenregal 16', Brustwerk; Peterskirche, Sinzig-am-Rhein, Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany; Walcker 1972."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
