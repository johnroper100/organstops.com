The name employed, according to Schlimbach (1843), to designate a manual stop, of 2 ft. pitch, which may be either of the Gemshorn or the Nachthorn tonality. Such a stop, both as a harmonic-corroborator and timbre-creator, would be found valuable in artistic registration, furnishing a vivid contrast to the Piccolo, 2 ft. Wedgwood also lists it with some alternative definitions: The Hornlein is either (1) a small 8 ft. reed (e.g., Lucerne); (2) an octave Horn; (3) a Spitzfl\u00f6te; or (4) a Nachthorn. Sumner gives yet another definition, a compound stop which we describe under the synonym Hornle.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains but a single example:", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "H\u00f6rnlein 1' [flue], Positiv; Kunitachi College of Music, Tokyo, Japan; von Beckerath 1983."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
