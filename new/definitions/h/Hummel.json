(Ger.) Hummel = humming; chen is a diminutive suffix. A device for causing two of the largest pipes in the organ to speak simultaneously, originally with the intent of summarily arousing such poor mortals as succumbed to the frailties of the flesh and snored in the sermon. Adlung provides a different description: H\u00fcmmelchen outside [the context of] the organ belongs among the bagpipes; see Praetorius, p. 42. But on p. 193 he names it among the auxiliary stops, as being intended to imitate [the bagpipe].", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
