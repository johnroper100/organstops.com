Perhaps a (wooden) Glockenspiel which could be made of many materials, including glass; but possibly a flute Mixture or single-rank-high wide Flageolet such as made the \ufffdanvil\ufffd effect at G\u00f6rlitz in about 1700 when drawn with the Quintadena 16'. Maclean further speculates that it may have been a tremulant (\ufffdwith a noisy clatter?\ufffd) or a joke stop like the Fuchsschwanz, and translates the name as \ufffdwooden clappers\ufffd. A modern German dictionary, however, translates gelachter as \ufffdlaughter\ufffd, not \ufffdclappers\ufffd. Examples None known. Contributions welcome. Bibliography Irwin[1]: Appendix D.
