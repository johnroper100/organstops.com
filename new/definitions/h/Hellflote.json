Audsley describes it as being of small scale; Irwin claims it is of moderate scale. Wedgwood gives a completely different definition, equating it with either the Campana or Sharp Mixture. Maclean equates it with the Flageolet, Flautino, Octavin, and Piccolo. The name comes from the German word hell, meaning \ufffdclear\ufffd.
