However, the German word human translates as \ufffdhumane\ufffd or \ufffdaffable\ufffd. Audsley even quotes Seidel in a footnote (with misspellings that have been corrected here) which supports our interpretation: \ufffdHuman heisst so viel als lieblich, das Humangedeckt: ein liebliches, angenehmes, gedecktes Register. Man findet es gew\u00f6hnlich zu 8 Fusston.\ufffd Translation: \ufffd\ufffdHuman\ufffd means the same as \ufffdlieblich\ufffd, the Humangedeckt: a lovely, pleasant, covered register. One normally finds it at 8' pitch.\" Audsley describes the Humangedeckt as being of 8' pitch, having a soft, compound tone, and pipes similar to those of the LieblichGedeckt, but of smaller scale and voiced on lower pressure. Wedgwood lists it at 4' pitch, calling it \ufffdsweet-toned\ufffd. Adlung states that the Humangedackt is \ufffdmade to imitate a flute\ufffd, and that it is the same as the Stillgedackt.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known, though Wedgwood cites \ufffdSt. Gertrud, Hamburg.\ufffd", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
