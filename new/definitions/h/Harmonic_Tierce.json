The effect of this treatment is to increase their power without giving rise to concomitant development of their own upper partials. As a result they also stand better in tune and are less affected by fluctuation of wind pressure than the true-length varieties. The practice is not unknown abroad. See Harmonic Stopped Twelfth.
