It furnishes the proper bass to the manual unison stop, and is, accordingly, a Pedal Organ stop; but rarely introduced in modern Organs. In The Art of Organ-Building Audsley lists Hohlfl\u00f6tenbass, as being synonymous with Grosshohlfl\u00f6te but lists them separately in his later work Organ-Stops and their Artistic Registration.The suffix bass is used with some consistency by German organ builders to indicate that a stop belongs to the pedal division, and does not necessarily imply a lower pitch.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples are listed below.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Hohlfl\u00f6tenbass 4', Pedal; Dorfkirche, Elxleben, Thuringia, Germany; Franciscus Volkland 1748."}, {"link": "", "name": "Hohlfloetenbass 8', Pedal; Domes St. Maria, Riga, Latvia; Walcker 1883.
