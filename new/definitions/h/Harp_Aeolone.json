They are under the control of an expression device (Gale's patent), whereby every shade of power can be instantly obtained, either for accenting a single note or a whole chord. A patent tuning device enables them to be rapidly tuned. Wedgwood also lists Harp Aeoline and Harp Aeolone, but says only \ufffdsee Aeoline\ufffd, for which stop he lists Harp Aeolian as a synonym, but says nothing more about either of the three names. Audsley also mentions the stop: Free-reed stops devoid of resonators have recently been introduced by certain English organ-builders, with favorable results in tonal combination and registration. In the Organ in Colston Hall, Bristol, built by Norman & Beard in 1905, there are three such free-reed stops, labeled Harp Aeolone, Kerophone, and Saxophone.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
