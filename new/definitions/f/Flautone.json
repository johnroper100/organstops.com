The pipes of this stop are either open or covered, according to the ideas of the builder, or, probably according to the stop-apportionment of the divisional Organ in which it is placed. The Flautone in the North Organ in the Cathedral of Milan is of metal with a covered wooden bass, while that in the Choir of the Organ in the church of San Gaetano, Florence, is a metal stop of 8 ft. pitch, the pipes of which are apparently open.* Audsley's entry ends with a footnote: \ufffdA la p\u00e9dale, les Italiens l'emploient sous le nom de Flautone, Fl\u00fbton, ou gross fl\u00fbte douce. Celle de huit-pieds, qui est la plus usit\u00e9e, chante admirablement les adagios en solo ou en choeur, mais seule \u00e0 la main; il ne faut pourtant pas trop augmenter le nombre des parties, la confusior s'y jetterait, et adieu l'effet instrumental.\ufffd - Regnier. This footnote translates as follows: In the pedal, the Italians employ it under the name of Flautone, Fl\ufffdton, or gross fl\u00fbte douce. The eight-foot stop, which is most used, admirably sings the adagios in solo or chorus, but only in the manuals; one however should not increase the number of the parts too much, it would be thrown into confusion, and good-bye to the instrumental effect. In his entry for Dolzflote (also known as Fl\u00fbte Douce), Audsley quotes Seidel as saying: \ufffdIm Pedal soll diese Stimme zu 16' unter dem Namen Flautone vorkomen.\ufffd (\ufffdIn the pedal this stop appears at 16' under the name Flautone.\ufffd)", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
