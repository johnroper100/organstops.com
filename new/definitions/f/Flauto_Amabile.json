Wedgwood lists Amoroso and Sanftfl\u00f6te as synonyms for Flauto Amabile; Maclean considers Flauto Amabile to be synonymous with Flauto Dolce and Flauto Amoroso. Locher says \ufffdsee Fl\u00fbte d'Amour\ufffd, but in his entry for the latter mentions Amorosa but not Amoroso. Audsley alone lists all of those names separately. Regarding Flauto Amabile, he says: The suggestive name given to a small-scaled labial stop, of either 8 ft. or 4 ft. pitch, properly constructed of open wood pipes, yielding an extremely delicate and sweet unimitative flute-tone. In its best form, its pipes are slender, about one and a half times their width in depth, and have inverted mouths. The pipes should be made of clear spruce, fronted with mahogany or white maple so as to allow their mouths being carefully and accurately formed.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains seven examples of Flauto Amabile at 8' pitch, two at 4', and one at 16'.
