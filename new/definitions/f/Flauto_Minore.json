The German equivalent - Minorfl\u00f6te - has been adopted to designate a flute-toned stop of 4 ft. pitch, as in the Organ in the choir of the Cathedral of Breslau. In this latter sense the term in undesirable; for the terms Flauto Maggiore and Flauto Minore should refer to tone, - the only matter of importance to the organist, - not to the sizes of the stops only, which call for other distinguishing names. Wedgwood describes Flauto Minor thus: \ufffdCorrectly speaking an octave Flauto Major; but occasionally, and perhaps more sensibly, applied to a stop similar to the Flauto Major, but less powerful.\ufffd", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples are listed below.
