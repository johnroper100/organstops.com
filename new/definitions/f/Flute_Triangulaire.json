The tone is hollow and dull and not so prominent as that from the Hohlfl\u00f6te. The octave harmonic is strong, as well as the fundamental. Its firm, quick, neutral-colored speech can support the Diapasons and other flues well. ... Undoubtedly, the softer, higher-pitched overtones are absorbed in the more acute angles of these pipes. The decrease in scale caused by building only three walls tends to increase the number of higher overtones. Probably the decrease in scale overrides the offect of the absorbing sharp angles, at least in the smaller scales and smaller high-pitched pipes of the stop. This tone is subdued compared to that of a quadrangular Hohlfl\u00f6te. In his entry for Pyramid Flute, he adds \ufffdTriangular Flutes of tapered form are also made, and are quite dull in tone, although sometimes loud.\ufffd Maclean list the Fl\u00fbte Triangulaire as being of 4' pitch.
