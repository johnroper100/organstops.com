In his Organ Stops and their Artistic Registration he says: The term used to designate an open labial stop of 8 ft. and 4 ft. pitch, the pipes of which are square and inverted pyramidal in form, resembling those of the Dolcan in being larger at the top than at the mouth-line, and especially in the pipes of the bass octave, which have been made of wood. The name would be more appropriately applied to a stop the pipes of which are directly pyramidal; that is, square, and larger at the mouth-line than at the top, in this respect resembling the pipes of the Spitzfl\u00f6te, Gemshorn, and Cone Gamba. We have made wood pipes of thie form, having extremely low inverted mouths, which, voiced on wind of 2 3/8 inches, yielded exquisite tones having a rare combination of imitative flute- and string-tones, both of which could be distinctly heard as if fighting for supremacy. In The Art of Organ-Building Audsley describes it as being quadrangular rather than square, and says that its tone \ufffdvaries according to the scale, and treatment of the mouth, but, properly, it should be of a light and singing quality.\ufffd", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
