According to Maclean, it sometimes indicates a 4' Cor de Nuit. Wedgwood provides the following description: A special stop invented by Messrs. Conacher, of Huddersfield. It resembles the French Fl\u00fbte \u00e0 Chemin\u00e9e, but is of larger scale - about 4 in. at the CC pipe (4 ft. actual length). The tone is extremely liquid and brilliant, and of some power. In addition to being of value as a combinational stop, the Fl\u00fbte Couverte forms a most effective solo stop. The pipes are of pure tin, with chimneys from tenor C upwards, and with sliding (\ufffdcanister\ufffd) tops. The lips are arched. It is to be regretted that one rarely finds a specimen of this class of stop in England. The French builders of repute use the Fl\u00fbte \u00e0 Chemin\u00e9e extensively.
