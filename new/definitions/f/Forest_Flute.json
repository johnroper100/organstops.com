The smaller-scaled Waldfl\u00f6te or Orchestral Flute fulfills this definition in tone, but this Flute de Bois sounds other elements as well. The full-toned, smooth effect of the Clarabella is in it, as well as some horn-like overtones; other examples are said to have a \ufffdwoolly\ufffd indistinct timbre. It has also been made at 2' and 1', and heard in all divisions as a solo or ensemble voice. A well-polished upper lip or pipe-front of hardwood with rounded shape aids in making this unique tone quality.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples are listed below.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Forest Flute 4', Swell; Troy Music Hall, Troy, New York, USA; Odell 1882, 1890."}, {"link": "", "name": "Forest Flute 4', Gallery-Swell; St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York City, USA; Kilgen 1930."}, {"link": "", "name": "Forest Flute 4', Great; St. Joseph's Church, Dyer, Indiana, USA; Kimball 1933."}, {"link": "", "name": "Forest Flute 4', Swell; Cadet Chapel, United States Military Academy, West Point, New York, USA; Moller."}, {"link": "", "name": "Forest Flute 4', Choir; John Wanamaker Store, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}, {"link": "", "name": "Forest Flute 4', Solo; First Presbyterian Church, Medford, Oregon, USA; Schoenstein."}, {"link": "", "name": "Forest Flute 4', Choir; St. Paul's Parish (Episcopal), Washington, D.C., USA; Schoenstein 1996."}, {"link": "", "name": "Flute de Bois 8', Pedale; Oral Roberts University Chapel, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA; Lawrence Phelps 1975."}, {"link": "", "name": "Fl\u00fbte de Bois 8', Recit; Pacific Union College Church, Angwin, California, USA; Rieger 1984."}, {"link": "", "name": "Fl\u00fbte de Bois 4', Swell; First Presbyterian Church, Greenwood, South Carolina, USA; Goulding & Wood 2002.
