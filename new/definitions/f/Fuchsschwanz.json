A stop-knob bearing the inscription \ufffdNoli me tangere\ufffd (\ufffdDo not touch\ufffd) was attached to the console. As a reward for their curiosity, persons who, regardless of this injunction, touched the knob, thereby set free the catch of a spring, causing a huge foxtail to fly out into their faces. Sometimes the foxtail was simply attached to the stop knob. Having once drawn the tail out of the jamb, it was a matter of some difficulty to replace it. Meanwhile, the recalcitrant culprit was subject to the chaff of his comrades. There is a foxtail near the dwarf \ufffdPerkeo\ufffd, guarding the great Tun at Heidelberg Castle.
