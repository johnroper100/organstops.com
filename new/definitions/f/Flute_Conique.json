They were metal flutes of inverted conical form; that is, wider at the top than at the mouth. Audsley cites the examples at Saint-Sulpice, but incorrectly describes them as Spitzfl\u00f6tes, which are conical. Wedgwood describes the tone of the Fl\u00fbte Conique as \ufffdvery hard and powerful\ufffd. Maclean reports that some stoplists for St. Sulpice list its examples as Fl\u00fbte Pyramidale; he describes them as medium-large scale conical flutes. Maclean is the only known source to mention the name Fl\u00fbte Pyramidale. Since Cavaill\u00e9-Coll's time, the name Fl\u00fbte Conique seems to have become a synonym for Spitzfl\u00f6te, having a conical form (narrow at the top).
