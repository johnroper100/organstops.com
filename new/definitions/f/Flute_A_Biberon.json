Each metal pipe has, instead of a flat cap, a domed cap, to which the chimney is attached. The Fl\u00fbte \u00e0 Biberon is said to date from the 1700's, though apparently it was never used by the major builders of the time. The French word biberon means \"baby's bottle\". John-Paul Buzard, one of the few builders currently making this stop, describes its tone as \ufffdvery colorful\ufffd, too much so (for his ears) for a 4' stop. It has more of the octave harmonic than the Fl\u00fbte \u00e0 Chemin\u00e9e, on account of having narrow bodies and wider chimneys, and provides a better support for higher-pitched Principals. He gives the specifications for his first prototype 8' Fl\u00fbte \u00e0 Biberon as follows:", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Flute a Biberon 8', Great; Chapel of Saint John the Divine, University of Illinois, Champaign, Illinois, USA; Buzard 1991.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Flute a Biberon 8', Great; Chapel of Saint John the Divine, University of Illinois, Champaign, Illinois, USA; Buzard 1991."}, {"link": "", "name": "Flute a Biberon 8', Swell; St. Leon Church, Montreal, Canada; Guilbault-Therien 1995."}, {"link": "", "name": "Flute a Biberon 8', Great; Southminster Presbyterian Church, Arlington, Illinois, USA; Buzard 1993."}, {"link": "", "name": "Flute a Biberon 8', Great; Union United Methodist Church, Belleville, Illinois, USA; Buzard 1993."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
