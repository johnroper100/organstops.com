{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Flautada", "origin": "Spanish", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Audsley lists this stop with the following description: The name applied by Spanish organ-builders to open lingual stops yielding flute- and organ-tone. Thus: Flautada de 13 signifies a Flute or Principal, 8 ft.; Flautada de 26 signifies a Flute or Double Diapason, 16 ft.; and Flautada de 52, the stop belonging to the Pedal Organ, is in all essentials similar to the Double Diapason, 32 ft. Examples are to be found in the Organs of the Cathedrals of Burgos, Seville, and Valladolid, and also in other important Spanish instruments. Irwin lists it with this description: A Foundation stop of 32', 16', or 8' on either manuals or pedals, the 32' manual rank being somewhat unusual. It is formed from open, large-scale, heavy-walled wooden pipes that yield a tone of great weight and loudness. It is a Principal-Flute hybrid. It is interesting to note that, while Audsley implies that Flautada is not a rare stop, Osiris, which contains specifications of over 200 Spanish organs, does not contain a single example of the name. Osiris does, however, contain hundreds of examples of Flautado. Is it possible that Audsley misspelled Flautado as Flautada, and Irwin perpetuated the error? On the other hand, a Spanish dictionary lists both flautada and flautado as meaning \ufffdflute stop in an organ\ufffd.
