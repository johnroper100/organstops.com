The scale varied, as did the tone. Adlung describes its tone as quite plain and unpretentious\ufffd, and its construction as \ufffda bit conical\ufffd, and states that it is sometimes synonymous with Spitzfl\u00f6te. Seidel (by way of Audsley) and Wedgwood describe its tone as thin, and Locher calls it \ufffdsharply intonated\ufffd; Williams describes the metal varieties as having strong and round tone, and the wooden varieties gentle tone. Audsley conjectures that, since the name can be translated as \ufffdflat flute\ufffd, the original Flachfl\u00f6te pipe must have been of wood, with the mouth on the wide side, rather than on the narrow side as is more common. However, he also states that this would have given it a \ufffdfull and distinctive intonation\ufffd. Grove and Williams state that the name is more likely a corruption of \ufffdflageolet flute\ufffd. This stop can be found at 8', 4', 2', or 1' pitch, and dates from the early 17th century. Only the names Flachfl\u00f6te and Flachpfeife appear in the literature; we assume the other names to be synonyms.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Grossflachfl\u00f6te", "link": "Grossflachflote"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains about 80 examples of Flachfl\u00f6te, seven dozen examples, most at 2' pitch, with a few at 1', 4', and 8', four examples of Flachflute, all at 2' pitch, two examples of Flachfloit, and one of Flachflojte.
