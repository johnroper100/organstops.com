In the first case, the \ufffdFirst\ufffd stop is usually the loudest one. Even in the latter case each stop is voiced differently from the other, otherwise phase cancellation would cause them to interfere with rather than augment each other.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains 100 examples of \ufffdFirst\ufffd and \ufffdSecond\ufffd, one third of which are in the organ in the John Wanamaker Store, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Osiris contains 30 examples of \ufffdThird\ufffd, of which 13 are in the Wanamaker organ, and 14 examples of \ufffdFourth\ufffd, of which 10 are in the Wanamaker organ. That instrument is also the only known instrument to use \ufffdFifth\ufffd and \ufffdSixth\ufffd as stop name prefixes. Over half the examples of \ufffdFirst\ufffd, \ufffdSecond\ufffd and \ufffdThird\ufffd are Open Diapasons.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
