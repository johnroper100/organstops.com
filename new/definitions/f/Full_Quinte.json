The F\u00fcllquinte may be of wood or metal, and of open or covered pipes. When drawn with a full-toned stop of 8 ft. pitch, it produces the differential 16 ft. tone. The differential tone Audsley speaks of is only discernable to the human ear at low frequencies; see Resultant.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
