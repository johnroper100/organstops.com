By this means the tone is caused to blare out at the audience in a manner generally savouring more of noise than of music. Examples are very common in Spain, where such pipes are often made of brass. The first Fan Tubas in this country [England] were inserted at York Minster (Hill) in 1844, having been presented by Hudson, \ufffdthe Railway King.\ufffd They were removed in the recent rebuild (1902-3). Bonavia-Hunt attributes the York Minster stop to Harrison & Harrison. Maclean says: \ufffdAn early English example, called Fan Tuba, can still be found at the Guildhall, Cambridge, installed by Hill & Son around 1860.\ufffd.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
