It is described by Seidel this: \ufffdF\u00fcllfl\u00f6te, 4 Fusston gedeckt, aud 10 l\u00f6t. Metall, steht im Hauptwerk der von Buckow in Jahren 1830/31 in der Stadtpfarrkirche zu Triebel in der Niederlausitz erbauten Orgel von 25 klangbaren Stimmen.\ufffd Ripienfl\u00f6te is mentioned only by Audsley, who lists it along with F\u00fcllfl\u00f6te as a synonym, saying: A stop, of 8 ft. pitch, yielding an unimitative flute-tone, of considerable volume without being unduly assertive or penetrating, used for filling up or imparting firmness and body to combinations of unison or foundation tone in a manual division, chiefly in the Hauptwerk or Great Organ. The term might be applied, with propriety, to such stops as the Clarabella or Offenefl\u00f6te [sic]; also to the Doppelfl\u00f6te, which possesses remarkable filling-up properties in all combinations in which it is introduced. Audsley does not mention the possible synonym Full Flute, which is described somewhat differently by Irwin. Wedgwood also lists F\u00fcllfl\u00f6te, but says only \ufffd4 ft. A Flute of full tone.
