It is a solo stop as well as a source of power and brass-like overtones for the bigger ensembles. It is probably most impressive when chorded and without the tremulant. Some examples are unenclosed to give a free sound unabsorbed by organ chamber walls. A few are mounted horizontally, and these should be referred to by the name Trompette en Chamade. Probably Trumpet Fanfare would be a more explicit name for this stop.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "No examples are known of a stop named simply \ufffdFanfare\ufffd.
