Compared to the Diapason Magna, this Diapason is more brilliant with harmonics, although not quite to the point of being a Stentorphone. Its intense and dominating fundamental is accompanied by a whole series of harmonics, which make it a solo stop of prime magnitude. . . . It is not primarily a chorus Diapason, its tone being too brilliant for proper blending with the Octave, Twelfth, etc. The Spanish word sonora means \ufffdsonorous, harmonious, loud, or clear\ufffd.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Diapason Sonora 8', 5-1/3', 4', 2', Chancel Pedal; Cadet Chapel, United States Military Academy, West Point, New York, USA; M.P.
