They are mentioned only by Adlung, who writes: Doppelt is a word that does not denote any particular stop, but rather is used if a stop is doubled. For example at Jena there is a \ufffdContrabass 32' doppelt\ufffd; since an open 16' is also present. At Gera there is a \ufffdVox humana doppelt\ufffd, as well as a Fl\u00f6tedouce 8'; see \ufffd.301. ... This much may be said about the Doppelfl\u00f6te: it is not unheard of for two pipes to be placed on each key, and consequently this interpretation is indeed possible. In this case it would be the same as the Duifl\u00f6t if the latter is sometimes conceived in the same way; see \ufffd.137. \ufffdDuplicat\ufffd likewise means the same thing as these words; for [Praetorius] continues: \ufffdOffen Chormass of a special type, Oktave, duplicat this.\ufffd Once again, this means either that the previous 2 stops, Offen Chormass and Oktave, are upon the same hole, or that they are both controlled one stop mechanism. And thus proceeds the rest.
