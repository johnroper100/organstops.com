It is properly formed of several ranks of very small-scaled open metal pipes, yielding a soft, singing quality of tone. When extreme softness is required, the ranks should be octave- and fifth-sounding only: but when a more assertive tone is desired, a third-sounding rank should appear in every break, as in the following example of five ranks: Dolce Cornet - V. Ranks. c3-c4 1 8 10 12 15 f#2-b3 1 8 12 15 17 f#1-f2 8 12 15 17 19 CC-f1 12 15 17 19 22 It will be observed that the introduction of the Seventeenth makes the stop a Sesquialtera in all save the top octave. Artistically voiced and scientifically graduated in tone this Cornet would be extremely valuable in refined registration. The following is a satisfactory composition for a Cornet of four ranks, octave- and fifth-sounding: Dolce Cornet - IV. Ranks. g#3-c4 1 8 12 15 c1-g3 8 12 15 19 C-B 12 15 19 22 CC-BB 15 19 22 26 Irwin also lists this stop, with this description: A soft compound manual stop made from several ranks of specially designed Dolce pipes, the fifth-sounding being softer than the octave-sounding. This is a useful accompaniment and timbre-creating stop. It may also be designed as a solo stop.
