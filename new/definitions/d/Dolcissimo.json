Audsley lists Dolcissimo with the following description: The term appropriately used to designate the softest flute-toned stop made. The extended term, Flauto Dolcissimo, will, however, be found more expressive, especially if the stop is voiced to yield an imitative tone - that of the orchestral Flute played pianissimo. In its best orm, the Dolcissimo is of 8 ft. pitch, constructed of small-scaled hard wood pipes, having very narrow inverted mouths. It should be voiced on wind of low pressure, not exceeding 2 1/2 inches, preferably of 1 1/2 inches. Wedgwood describes Dolcissimo and Dulcissima as follows: \ufffd16 ft.; 8 ft.
