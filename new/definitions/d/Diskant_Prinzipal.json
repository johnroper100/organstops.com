The stop has very rarely been carried to tenor C. This short stop was considered of considerable value by the old German organ-builders, on account of its power of reinforcing the weaker octaves of the unison foundation-work. This weakness was so forcibly realized by Christian Muller, that he inserted two pipes to each note in the treble of several of the more important stops in his noble Organ in the Cathedral of Haarlem. This matter might, with advantage, recieve serious consideration at the present time; for the natural weakness of the treble in the Organ still remains one of its tonal shortcomings. In The Art of Organ Building, Audsley describes five ways of overcoming weakness in the treble:", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Principal Diskant 16', Manual; Kangasala, Finland; Thule 1845.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Principal Diskant 16', Manual; Kangasala, Finland; Thule 1845."}, {"link": "", "name": "Principal Discant 8' (c'), Oberwerk; Jacobikirche, Dornburg, Thuringia, Germany; Gerhardt 1820."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
