Only a few flue stops are always made of inverted conical pipes (wider at the top than at the bottom), and the Dolcan is the most common of these. Found at 16', 8' or 4' pitch, its tone resembles that of the Dulciana, but is brighter and more open. According to Williams, the tone of the Dolcan seems to have not changed much over the centuries. Sumner calls it the precursor to the modern Dulciana. Grove dates it from around 1580 in the Netherlands and northern Germany.
