{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Dulciana Celeste", "origin": "English", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Listed only by Irwin, who says: An undulating manual stop of 8' composed of two ranks of Dulciana pipes, sometimes voiced especially for the c\u00e9leste function. Since this is a dull c\u00e9leste, it is more useful at a slow undulation, which will impair its timbre and the timbres of other stops less. It is usually normal-sharp, but normal-flat is also head in some examples. The sharp-flat pattern does not leave a normal rank free for combination. This sedate, quiet, somewhat colorless stop makes and ideal background and accompaniment tone. Bonavia-Hunt mentions the stop, saying: The earliest form of c\u00e9leste consists of two dulcianas, which tuned to beat at a slow pulsation rate gave a pleasing effect. This type of c\u00e9leste was in vogue for many years (often labelled \ufffdvox angelica\ufffd) until the introduction of string tone of the viol type suggested the string or violes c\u00e9lestes.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Echo Dulciana Celeste", "link": "EchoDulcianaCeleste"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Dulciana Celeste 8', Choir; Duke University Chapel, Durham, North Carolina, USA; Aeolian 1930.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Dulciana Celeste 8', Choir; Duke University Chapel, Durham, North Carolina, USA; Aeolian 1930."}, {"link": "", "name": "Dulciana Celeste 8', Swell; St. Matthew's Lutheran Church, Hanover, Pennsylvania, USA; Austin 1925-1982."}, {"link": "", "name": "Dulciana Celeste 8', Choir; Princeton University Chapel, Princeton, New Jersey, USA; Skinner 1927-8."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
