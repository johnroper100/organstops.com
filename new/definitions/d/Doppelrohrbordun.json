It contributes fundamental prime tone and a few of the lower-pitched overtones to any other stops without imprating character of its own to the combination. Scale and volume vary in this stop.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
