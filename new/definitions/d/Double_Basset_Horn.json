We are strongly in favor of such a stop being introduced in every Concert-room Organ just as it has been in the Organ in the Centennial Hall, Sydney, N.S.W. [Australia]. A beautiful family might be created by the addition of an Octave Basset-Horn, 4 ft.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
