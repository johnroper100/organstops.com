As made by Cavaill\u00e9-Coll it was a pedal which, on depression, drew down successively six or seven notes from the bottom of the pedal board upwards. The effet, as may well be imagined, is realistic -- particularly when the 32 ft. reed is drawn. As Mr. Robertson remarks, the contrivance is rather superfluous, since a really imposing effect can be got by sitting on the keys!
