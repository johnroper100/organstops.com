Most of the names refer to an old double-reed instrument, an ancestor of the bassoon, which some examples of this stop are intended to imitate. It has been made with either free or striking reeds, and with short resonators (1/8 to 1/4 length) of inverted conical or cylindrical metal, or of straight or pyramidal wood. The resonators are sometimes fully or partially capped. Audsley and Sumner given them a small scale; Wedgwood claims they are large scale. Its tone is most often described as being similar to the Bassoon. It can be found at a variety of pitches, but usually 8' or 16'. According to Grove, the names Touzyn, Toussein and Douseynen were early forms from around 1510. The name Doucaine does not appear in the literature, but we assume it to be a synonym: all known examples are reeds, dating from the second half of the 20th century.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Contra Dulcian", "link": "ContraDulcian"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains one example of Dolcian, listed below.

Of Dulcian and Dulzian there approximately 300 examples, of which approximately 75% are at 16' and nearly 25% are at 8', with three at 4', one each at 2' and 32', and two at 64' (resultants). There are 16 examples of Doucaine, all at 16' pitch except for one at 32' pitch, and one each at 8' and 4', borrowed from a 16' rank. The only known example of Dolciana is a flue. There are 40 examples of Dulciane, but only two are reeds. No examples of the other names are known.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Dolceaan 8', Bovenmanuaal; Westerkerk, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Duyschot 1686.
