{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Divinare", "origin": "Italian?", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Audsley lists this stop with the following description and footnotes: The somewhat inappropriate term used to designate a covered stop of 4 ft. pitch, belonging to the Covered Flutework, the tone of which is singularly soft and singing. Such a stop is very desirable in the Choir of a Church Organ, in a Chamber Organ, and in the Echo or Ancillary Aerial Organ of a Concert-Room instrument. Its presence would be productive of many charming effects in refined registration. The stop is made of both wood and metal: when of wood, the pipes are of small scale, and made narrow and deep so as to secure small mouths. Low-pressure wind is desirable. \ufffdDivinare, fl\u00fbte de bourdon de quatre-pieds, fl\u00fbte divine, est une singuli\u00e8re traduction de ce mot, et c'est la seule indiqu\u00e9e pour exprimer la qualit\u00e9 divinement sup\u00e9rieure de cette fl\u00fbte . . . \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s inconnue.\ufffd -- Regnier. \ufffdDivinare (vom Lat. divinus, g\u00f6ttlich), sondern es gedecktes Fl\u00f6tenwerk zu 4'. Die Intonation dieser Stimme muss dem Namen nach sehr sch\u00f6n sein.\ufffd -- Seidel. The footnotes translate roughly as follows: \ufffdDivinare, a 4' bourdon, divine flute, is a singular translation of this word, and it is only indicated to express the divinely superior quality of this flute . . . nearly unknown.\ufffd -- Regnier. \ufffdDivinare (from the Latin divinus: godlike), on the contrary is a stopped 4' flute. The intonation of this voice must, by its name, be very beautiful.\ufffd -- Seidel. Wedgwood also lists this stop, but merely quotes Seidel.
