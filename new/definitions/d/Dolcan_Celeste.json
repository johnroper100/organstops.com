It is even softer than the Dulciana C\u00e9leste, and, like that stop, forms a useful accompaniment or background effect for other stops or the softer portions of the church service, such as prayer. It is usually tuned to undulate quite slowly to maintain its timbre.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Dolcan Celeste II 8', Solo; Mother Church of Christ, Scientist, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Aeolian-Skinner 1951-2.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Dolcan Celeste II 8', Solo; Mother Church of Christ, Scientist, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Aeolian-Skinner 1951-2."}, {"link": "", "name": "Dolcan Celeste 8', Choir; Auditorium, Community of Christ (RLDS) World Headquarters Complex, Independence, Missouri, USA; Casavant 1993."}, {"link": "", "name": "Dolcan Celeste 8', Choir; Heinz Chapel, University of Pittsburgh, Pitsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA; Reuter 1995."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
