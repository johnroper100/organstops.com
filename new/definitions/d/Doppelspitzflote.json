It has been made of both wood and metal, at 8', 4', and (according to Irwin) 16' pitch. Regarding its tone, Irwin says: It is moderately soft and has elements of both the Flute and String in it. The lower-pitched overtones are made brighter than the higher-pitched, and the fundamental prime tone is noticeable. The metal specimens are a little brighter.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Doppelspitzfl\u00f6te 4', Echo; Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Breslau, Germany.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Doppelspitzfl\u00f6te 4', Echo; Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Breslau, Germany."}, {"link": "", "name": "Doppel Spitz Flute 8', Choir-Swell; Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA; Midmer-Losh."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
