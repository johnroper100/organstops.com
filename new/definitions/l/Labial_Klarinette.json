It was an open wooden pipe, with a very low and sharp-cut inverted lip. In tone it could hardly be said to imitate a Clarinet any more than an Oboe, what it most resembled was a \ufffdbee in a bottle.\ufffd Its adjustment was such as to render it liable to be thrown off its speech by a very slight accumulation of dust. Various tones, however, can be built up, for solo purposes, compositely. . . . In the remarkable organ built by the Austin Organ Co., of U.S.A., for the Angelus Co. (Mr. J. Herbert Marchall) at Regent House, Regent Street, W., may be heard a Flue Clarinet stop, built up of the Quintat\u00f6n 8 ft., and Viole d'Orchestre 8 ft. . . . Herr Laukhuff, of Wiekersheim, W\u00fcrttemburg, has recently (March, 1905) taken up the manufacture and voicing of ... Labial Clarinet - Viola and Quintat\u00f6n. Labial Klarinette is listed by Grove, whose entire description reads: \ufffd8 ft. A flue stop whose pipes have double-barrel shape with a constriction or waist in the middle of the tube.\ufffd", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains only one example of Labial Klarinette:", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Labialklarinette 4', Positiv; Cathedral, Paderborn, Germany; Sauer 1981."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
