It was, in all probability, sounded by a hammer action, as the real Dulcimer was played. Respecting this notable Organ, Dr. Rimbault remarks: \ufffdThis noble instrument (Schwarbrook's masterpiece) cost \u00a31400. It originally contained three remarkable stops - the Harp, Lute, and Dulcimer; but, in consequence of the \ufffddifficulty of keeping the strings in tune,\ufffd they were removed in 1763.\ufffd Wedgwood and Sumner also mention these stops, but have nothing to add.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
