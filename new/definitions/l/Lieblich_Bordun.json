Bonavia-Hunt and Maclean consider it equivalent to the Lieblich Gedackt, but Audsley maintains that the tone of the Lieblichbordun has more of the 2nd upper partial than the Lieblichgedeckt. Irwin says that it lacks the lightness of tone of the Gedeckt. Wedgwood considers it equivalent to the Double Stopped Diapason. Audsley gives the scale of a Schulze Lieblichbordun at CCC as being 3 5/8\" by 5\" with a mouth 3 3/4\" high.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris lists 34 examples of Lieblich Bordun/Bourdon at 16' pitch, and three at 8'.
