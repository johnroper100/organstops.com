{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Quint Flute", "origin": "English", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "This name has been used for three different stops, two of which are described elsewhere under the synonyms Flute Quint and Nasard Flute. The third is described by Audsley: A compound Quint Flute, 8 ft., has recently been introduced by Mr. George W. Till, of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania, USA], and inserted in the so-called Etherial Organ of the large Concert instrument in the Wanamaker Store, in Philadelphia. So far as our knowledge extends, this is the most noteworthy dual stop of 8 ft. pitch ever construted; and one that could only be inserted, under favorable conditions, in Concert-room Organs of the first magnitude. Its compound voice is of considerable grandeur, its tonality surpassing in depth and richness of color that of any other flute-toned stop known to have been produced up to the present time (1920). The principal rank is a Clear Flute, 8 ft., formed of open wood pipes from CC to c4, to which are added twelve open metal pipes for octave coupling. The scale is large, the C pipe measuring, internally, 8 inches in width by 10 1/2 inches in depth. The subordinate rank is a Quint, 5-1/3 ft., formed of covered wood pipes from CC to f#2 - 43 notes, and open metal pipes from g2 to c5 - 30 notes, all yielding a normal tone. The stop speaks on wind of 25 inches pressure.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
