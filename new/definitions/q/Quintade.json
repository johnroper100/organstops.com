The tone of this stop sounds with prominence in both the fundamental and the third harmonic, varying in proportion in the examples of the many organ builders. This stop could hardly be described as loud, but it is pervading without being too noticeable in any combination. In adding this stop to any combination, the organist should be concerned as to whether the \ufffdTwelfth\ufffd component will produce an overly pungent effect, sometimes called the \ufffdrustle of the Quint\ufffd. This stop is practically synonymous with Quintadena and Quintaten, though according to some authorities (including Irwin) the amount of 3rd harmonic differs.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Rohrquintade", "link": "Rohrquintadena"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains around 100 examples, about a two thirds of which are at 8', and about a third are at 16'.
