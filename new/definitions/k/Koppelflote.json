According to Audsley, it is another name for a Koppel of 8' pitch. Irwin describes it as an open metal flute of 8' or 4' pitch, having a tone that is midway between those the Gemshorn and a bright cylindrical metal flute. Irwin and Maclean describe its construction as similar to that of the Spindelfl\u00f6te Regarding contemporary practices, John A. Panning, Tonal Director of Dobson Pipe Organ Builders, Lake City, Iowa writes: Generally, Koppelfl\u00f6ten have short cones (c. 1/4 of the body length), while Spillfl\u00f6ten have long cones (1/2 body length). A similar thing holds true for the diameter of the hole at the end of the cone: Koppelfl\u00f6ten often have smaller holes than Spillfl\u00f6ten, which might be 1/2 of the diameter or more. Today most Koppelfl\u00f6ten and Spillfl\u00f6ten have movable canisters (felted or papered), not flexible ears, for tuning. The photograph shows a M\u00f6ller Koppelfl\u00f6te pipe. The spindel-shaped top (which is closed) can be moved up or down for tuning.
