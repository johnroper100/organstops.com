Skinner, who describes it as follows: A pair of diminutive Erz\u00e4hlers, one rank tuned sharp ot the other, producing the undulating effect of a Celeste. Since a single Erz\u00e4hler pipe sounds both fundamental and octave, a pair of thee pipes must sound four simultaneous tones. Since one pipe is sharper than the other, their speech creates on Celeste at unison pitch and another of twice the frequency an octave higher. The Kleiner Erz\u00e4hler has an affinity for the Celesta, or Harp, in combination with which it produces a charming effect of mysticism. The first example of this stop appears in the Fourth Presbyterian Church, Chicago [Illinois, USA]. It was designed as a tribute to Mrs. Emmons Blaine, donor of the organ. Irwin lists Kleinerz\u00e4hler with a somewhat different description: A Foundation stop of 4' on the manuals, frequently serving as the softer of two 4' stops on the Great or Choir. These Erz\u00e4hler pipes may be smaller in scale than the 8' rank, and are of unusually easy blend with all families of organ tone. Sometimes two 4' ranks speak from a single stop knob, although they are not tuned as a c\u00e9leste. This device produces a sound of greater intensity without hardness of quality. This soft Octave fades into the tones of the other flue stops without being conspicuous, lending them a transparent, mildly bright tone. Occasionally this name may refer to a soft 8' Erz\u00e4hler.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "The dozen and a half examples in Osiris overwhelmingly support Skinner's definition over Irwin's, though it must be pointed out that all but three of them are by Skinner or Aeolian/Skinner, and one of those three was a rebuild of a Skinner. Only one example is at 4' pitch, and it is a celeste. Only one example is known to not be a celeste; for three other examples the stoplist is ambiguous as to whether they are celestes; all other examples are celestes, some drawing the ranks separately and some drawing together. The earliest examples date from 1925; Skinner did not give a date for the Fourth Presbyterian organ mentioned above.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Kleinerz\u00e4hler 8', Great; Gallery organ, First Presbyterian Church, San Anselmo, California, USA; Aeolian-Skinner 1966.
