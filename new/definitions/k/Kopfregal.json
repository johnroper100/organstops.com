Audsley says: The usual form of the resonator was that of a short body surmounted by a headpiece in the shape of two truncated cones joined together at their bases; a form which, considerably modified, has been followed in the resonators of the free-reed Cor Anglais. This form, however, was not invariably adopted in the old Kopfregal of the early German organ-builders.
