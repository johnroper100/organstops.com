Praetorius, l.c., p. 148, says that it is a 4' pitch and has a little knob on top, like a button; this knob has a cleft in the middle, like an open helmet, so that the sound (Resonanz) is immediately reflected back into the lower resonator. It is a reed stop that sounds lovely and well. The German word kopf means \ufffdhead\ufffd or \ufffdcrown\ufffd.
