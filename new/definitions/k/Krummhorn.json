It has varied in construction and timbre over the centuries. While it takes its name from the instrument of the same name, a capped reed with a curved body and a muffled, buzzing tone, the organ stop in its most familiar form has a tone resembling that of the Clarinet, though that tone did not develop, according to Williams, until the early 1800's. In the classical French organ (1650-1790) it was the reed on the Positif: while the Positif might contain other reeds, and other divisions might contain Cromornes, no French classic organ of any size lacked one in its Positif. Here it was used as both a solo and a combinational stop; it was often specified in the titles of compositions, and it dominated the Grand Jeu of the Positif. It was usually made with narrow cylindrical half-length resonators. According to Dom Bedos, the Cromorne was seldom used in the Grand Orgue, but usually appeared in the Positif, but usually only in small instruments which did not have enough space for a Trompette, and rarely in large instruments. This contradicts other evidence, which shows that the Cromorne was an essential tonal ingredient of the classical French organ. Wedgwood reports that the name Krummhorn was used for Clarinet stops which extended below tenor C, at a time when the Clarinet stopped at tenor C. Locher claims that it has a soft horn tone, and Audsley quotes Seidel as saying: Properly \ufffdCormorne\ufffd, from cor \ufffdhorn\ufffd and morne \ufffdmournful, still, soft\ufffd, signifying a soft, quiet Horn, is a lingual stop of a delicate intonation, of 8 ft. or 4 ft. pitch, of tin or pipe metal, open or shaded, and sometimes formed of small-scaled cylindrical pipes. Clearly, neither Locher nor Seidel were describing the French classical stop. Bonavia-Hunt describes it as a loud, broad-toned Clarinet. The name Cremona is a corruption, and has other meanings. Hopkins & Rimbault give a good example of how much knowledge regarding the Baroque had been lost by the Victorian period. That source claims: \ufffdThe name Krumm-horn ... signifies a Cornet or small Shawm of irregular form. ... A Clarionet of deeper pitch ... is known in England as the Corno di Bassetto, and in Germany as the Krumm-horn (crooked-horn).\ufffd The krummhorn, cornet, shawm, and corno di bassetto (basset horn) are all, of course, distictively different instruments, as are the stops that bear their names.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Holzkrummhorn", "link": "Holzkrummhorn"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains about 300 examples of Cromorne, about 20 dozen examples of Krummhorn, 17 of Kromhoorn, 16 of Krumhorn, 14 of Cromhorne, three of Crumhorn, and one of Cormorne.
