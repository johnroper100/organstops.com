Applied to an organ stop, the name is particularly unfortunate, serving as the word does in America to designate steam organs sometimes employed at fairs, and the steam whistles used on board ship. 8 ft.; 4 ft. The Kalliope, which was invented by Mr. Hope-Jones, was composed of stopped pipes of exceedingly large scale. The tone was hollow and peculiar, with a beautiful \ufffdbloom\ufffd in the tenor and middle octaves. There was an example in the first Hope-Jones organ at St. George, Hanover Square, W. Scale - Kalliope, 4 ft. tone. CC, 4 in.; T.C. 2 1/8 in/; Mid. C, 1 7/16 in. Mouth bearded, and the upper lip left as low as possible without the stop developing into a Cor de Nuit.
