It has been made of 5-1/3 ft., 2-2/3 ft., and 1-1/3 ft. pitch; but Seidel says that in Organs constructed in his time it was very seldom inserted. This would appear to have been the case, for we have failed to find a single record of the insertion of a Waldquinte in any Organ. Wolfram (1815) and Schlimbach describe the stop as similar in form an tonality to the Waldfl\u00f6te.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Wald Quint 10-2/3', 5-1/3', Great-Solo; Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA; Midmer-Losh 1929-32.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Wald Quint 10-2/3', 5-1/3', Great-Solo; Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA; Midmer-Losh 1929-32."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
