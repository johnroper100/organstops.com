{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Wooden Open Flute", "origin": "English", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "This stop is mentioned only by Irwin, who describes it thus: An open rank of Flute pipes of wood, at 16', 8', or 4' on the manuals, and 16' or 8' pedal pitch. THis stop is of less volume and brightness than the Major Open Flute of wooden form. This versatile Flute is somewhat neutral in timbre, rather than being distinctively colored like the Hohlfl\u00f6te or smooth in tone like the Clarabella. It is a solo voice of bright, clean tone. It is a tone builder, as are all open Flutes. It is not obvious in combination, giving its natural overtones to any stop, even a String, inconspicuously, because they taper from the fundamental evenly and quickly.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
