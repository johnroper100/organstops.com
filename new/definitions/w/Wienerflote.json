As a rule, it occurs on one of the upper manuals as an 8 ft. or 4 ft. solo stop, more particularly in Swiss Organs, where it might with equal correctness be called Concert Flute. Under this name I have found it on the third manual of Walcker's organ at M\u00fchlhausen. It may also be called Zartfl\u00f6te and Sanftfl\u00f6te; labelled thus, it occurs as 4-ft. and 8-ft. tone in the Nicolaikirche, Leipsic. The denomination \ufffdWienerfl\u00f6te\ufffd lacks all etymological or or historical foundation. In the new [1888] Votiv Organ, although this stands in Vienna itself, there is not a single Wienerfl\u00f6te amongst its sixty-one speaking stops. The competent builder of this organ has, however, placed a Wienerfl\u00f6te on the third manual of the cathedral organ at Riga, in order to satisfy the increasing demand for a stop of this name. Wienerfl\u00f6te is one of the most useful stops on the upper manuals, not only as a solo stop, but also for combination with any other stop. I found it particularly beautiful in combination with Oboe and Flauto Traverso. Audsley's entry consists predominantly of quotations from Locher's entry, with the following additional material: On the Third Manual of the Walcker Organ in the Cathedral of Vienna there is a Wienerfl\u00f6te, 8 ft. It has been generally understood that the tone of the Wienerfl\u00f6te closely resembled the imitative tone of the Flauto Traverso; but Locher's example of effective combination would seem to indicate a different tonality; unless the combination of the labial stops merely increased the imitative flute-tone. The pipes of the Wienerfl\u00f6te are open, quadrangular, and have inverted circular or semicircular mouths, partly over or against which are adjusted sloping caps. Such a formation would point to the production of an imitative quality of flute-tone, but not so pronounced as that of the harmonic Flauto Traverso, nor so valuable in solo effects or registration. Maclean considers it to be part of the Melodia family.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains about a dozen examples of Wienerfl\u00f6te, all but one at 8' pitch, and a single example Deutsche Fl\u00f6te.
