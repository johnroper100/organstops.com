{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Sch\u00f6ngedeckt", "origin": "German", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Irwin describes this stop as follows: A stopped wooden Flute of 8' on the manuals, resembling a Gedeckt or one of the larger-scaled Lieblichgedeckts in structure and tone color. This particular name seems to be associated with the examples that have a resonant, \ufffdsinging\ufffd tone, putting this Flute in the solo class. Some examples are moderate in scale, but all are quite smooth and pure even in the upper notes. The third harmonic is not so noticeable in this stopped Flute, nor does the fundamental (first harmonic) sound overly intense. The cut-up is quite high and the upper lip is polished or leaded, the whole front of the pipe usually being made from a hardwood. The resulting smooth, round timbre is often reminiscent of the Tibia Clausa, but this stop has none of the intensity of the Tibia. It is rounder in tone and louder than the Gedeckt. Audsley describes it as being of small scale, and having a \ufffdbeautiful\ufffd tone (as implied by the German word schon), and calls it \ufffdpractically synonymous\ufffd with the Lieblichgedeckt. Wedgwood considers the two stops to be synonymous.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
