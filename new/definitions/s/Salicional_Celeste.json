For normal use, it is certainly the best; and where it is not possible to introduce more than one form of c\u00e9leste into an organ, perhaps this one should be given the preference. There is an excellent example in the swell division of the organ in the Christian Science Church, Curzon Street, W., which is composed of a pair of slotted salicionals.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
