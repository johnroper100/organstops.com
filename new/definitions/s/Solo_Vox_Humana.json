Some examples of this name have some of the Krumet or Krummhorn or Clarinet quality in their tones to enable them to carry better and sound the pitches more obviously, since many examples of the \ufffdVox\ufffd lack ground tone. In a whole chorus of Vox Humanas it would be the chief unison rank, perhaps being called a Major Vox Humana. Strony lists Solo Vox Humana with the following description: This term is used to denote the Vox Humana in the solo chamber. Usually, this Vox Humana is the larger of two in the same instrument. In some cases, it may be on a higher wind pressure. In most cases, this somewhat larger Solo Vox Humana is menat to be paired with the also larger Solo Tibia Clausa.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "No examples of Major Vox Humana are known.
