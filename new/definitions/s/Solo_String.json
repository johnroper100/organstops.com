{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Solo String", "origin": "English", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Maclean describes this stop as follows: The Solo String was a Wurlitzer variety of the [Hope-Jones String Gamba] designed for theatre use. The word Solo in this instance had reference to the Solo expression chamber in which it was normally placed, rather than to any suggestion of value in a solo capacity. Strony has this to say: A powerful and bright String that appeared on larger instruments. The Publix #1 model had a Solo String in each chamber. Sometimes these tow strings are at different volume levels, with the one in the left chamber being softer than the one on the right. The Fox-Special Wurlitzers had especially wonderful examples voiced on 25\" wind pressure, which was necessary to make a statement in those large instruments installed in larger buildings. Most Solo Strings are only extended down to 8' pitch. On the big instruments, a 16' Octave was provided. In the manuals, it usually appears at 16' and 8' pitch. On a Wurlitzer, the Solo String is the loudest of all the Strings.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Solo String; Emery Theatre, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA; Wurlitzer.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Solo String; Emery Theatre, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA; Wurlitzer."}, {"link": "", "name": "Solo String 16', 8' I & II; Fisher Theatre, Detroit, Michigan, USA; Wurlitzer 1928.
