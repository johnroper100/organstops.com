It is voiced to extend upward all of the louder Diapasons, such as the Diapason Magna, Stentor Diapason, and Grand Diapason, whether of chorus or solo voicing. Its voice is also a source of brilliance to the Chorus Reeds, like the Tuba Magna and Trumpet, giving them a natural train of harmonics, starting at the octave pitch. According to Greek legend, Stentor was a herald in the Trojan war, described by Homer as having a voice as loud as fifty men.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Stentor Octave 4', Solo, Fanfare; Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA; Midmer-Losh 1929-32.
