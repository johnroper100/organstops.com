{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Solo Clarinet", "origin": "English", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Mentioned only in passing by Irwin, who says: The distinct tonality of a solo stop sets it apart from other ranks of the same name. The term Solo need not be included in the name, but frequently has been in the theater organs, since two Clarinets or two Tibia Clausas may be included in the same organ on the same or different manuals. Then Solo Clarinet and just Clarinet are used on the stop keys. Major Clarinet and Minor Clarinet have somewhat different meanings, not always implying the solo tonality. Examples None known.
