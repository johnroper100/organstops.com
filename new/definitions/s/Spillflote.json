According to Irwin, the length of the conical portion may be anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 the total speaking length. Since the top of the pipe cannot be manipulated for tuning, tuning is accomplished using large ears on either side of the mouth. Audsley recommends a 1/5 mouth, with a 1/2 cut-up, and while he states that German scales for this stop were usually small, Grove states that they were wide. The opening at the top, according to Audsley, varies in size, but when it is small, its bright tone is between that of the Rohrfl\u00f6te and Spitzfl\u00f6te. Wedgwood and Irwin maintain that this stop has no distinctive tone, though Sumner calls it \ufffdbeautiful\ufffd. Audsley considers it to be almost identical to the Schwiegel, though Irwin claims that the Schwiegel is larger in scale. While various sources date this stop from the first half of the 16th century, there is at least one example from the 15th century (see below). The illustration is Audsley's. The names Spillpfeife, Spielpfeife, Spielfl\u00f6te and Speelfluit do not appear in the literature. We assume them to be synonyms, though there is reportedly some evidence that the Spielfl\u00f6te, whose name means \ufffdplay flute\ufffd, may be conical rather than half-conical. Maclean writes: There is evidence of considerable confusion among the Baroque builders between the two types of Full Conical (Spitzfl\u00f6te) and Half-Conical (Spillfl\u00f6te) pipes, as the prefixes Spitz and Spill were frequently interchanged.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Spillfl\u00f6te is the most common name, with over five dozen examples in Osiris, compared to eight for Spillflute and eleven for Spindel Flute. Most of those are at 4' pitch, about a fifth are at 8', with a handful at 2'. Osiris also contains nineteen examples of Spielfl\u00f6te at 8' pitch, fifteen at 4' pitch, and one at 2', all from the 20th century except for one by Schnitger. Of Spillpfeife it contains 28 examples at 8' pitch, and two each at 2' and 4' pitch. It contains a dozen examples of Speelfluit at 4' pitch, one at 8' pitch, and two each at 2' and 3' (2-2/3') pitch.
