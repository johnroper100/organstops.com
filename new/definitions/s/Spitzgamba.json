The pipes are of open conical form, though Audsley claims that they have sometimes been made inverted conical. According to Hopkins & Rimbault, it was used frequently by Hill & Sons, and had a \ufffdrather crisp\ufffd tone. Audsley gives a ratio of 1:2 between the top and mouth-line diameters, and specifies a 1/3 to 2/7 mouth with low cut-up and harmonic bridges, and medium scale. He describes its tone as singing and delicate. Wedgwood describes its tone as midway between that of the Diapason and the Gemshorn, and says \ufffdthe stop known as Cone Diapason is practically a distinction without a difference.\ufffd According to Irwin, it is less keen than any other form of Gamba.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Bell Gamba", "link": "BellGamba"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains 15 examples of Spitzgamba at 8' pitch, one at 4' pitch, and one example of Cone Gamba.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Cone Gamba 16', Choir; York Minster Church; Hill, 1863."}, {"link": "", "name": "Cone Gamba 16', Choir-Swell; Cone Gamba 8', Swell; Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA; Midmer-Losh."}, {"link": "", "name": "Spitz Gamba 8', Great; Town Hall, Leeds, England; Gray & Davison 1859."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
