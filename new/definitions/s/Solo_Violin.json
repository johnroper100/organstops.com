This String has a tone that is currint and keen, with some dissonance from its upper partials, not always louder than the other Viols of the same organ, but more consipicuous in tone. It does not necessarily have the same timbre as the Grand Viol stop, but it is probably more orchestral in coloring. Like the Grand Viol, it is probably most suitable in a special division of only Strings, where it cannot unbalance the harmonic structure of the ensemble. Solo Viols are more usable with a noticeable amount of fundamental.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Solo Muted Violin", "link": "SoloMutedViolin"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Solo Violin 8', Great, Swell; Ninth Church of Christ, Scientist, San Francisco, California, USA; Aeolian-Skinner 1971.
