It is usually made with inverted mouths, and is of small or medium scale. One example by Hill measures 1 3/4\" x 1 3/8\" at tenor C. Most sources liken its soft tone to that of the Waldflote, and some consider it to be the octave of that stop. Skinner likens it to the Melodia, and Audsley places it between the two. According to Wedgwood, it is occasionally made of metal rather than wood. Irwin gives the synonym Echo Melodia, and may have coined it; no examples of that name are known.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains eleven examples, all at 4' pitch, the earliest of which are listed below.
