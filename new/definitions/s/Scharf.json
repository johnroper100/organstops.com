Audsley, Grove and Williams specify a small scale. Most sources give it one or more third-sounding ranks, though according to Audsley the old English examples lacked them. Grove, who dates it from around 1500, also implies that third-sounding ranks were a later development in this mixture: early Dutch and German examples were high-pitched like the Zimbel, and distinct from the Terzzimbel; mid-19th century examples frequently contained a high third-sounding rank.
