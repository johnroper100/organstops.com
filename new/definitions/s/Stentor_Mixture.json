This stop aids both loud flue and Chorus Reed ensembles by being quick-speaking, filled up with a complete complement of harmonics, and of good blend with Chorus Reeds because of its freedom from the louder dissonant partials. Devices to increase its loudness, as well as its cleanness of tone, are harmonic-length ipes, big scales, and inverted-conical form. It lifts up all other stops to a high level of brilliane and sounds itself like a Reed when played staccato. According to Greek legend, Stentor was a herald in the Trojan war, described by Homer as having a voice as loud as fifty men.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Stentor Mixture VII (8' ,5-1/3', 4', 2-2/3', 2', 1-1/3', 1'), Fanfare; Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA; Midmer-Losh 1929-32.
