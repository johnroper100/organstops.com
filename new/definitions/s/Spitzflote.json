All of the names describe or suggest the pipe form, except for Iula and Jula, which have alternate meanings. The name Spitsfluit does not appear in the literature; we assume it to be a synonym. While this pipe form is a common one, dating back to the late 15th century (according to Grove), it is not always clearly evidenced by the name on the stop control. The amount of taper has varied considerably, with the top diameter being as much as 3/4 or as little as 1/5 the diameter at the mouth. According to some sources, the English have typically used a gentler taper than the Germans. The pipes are usually tuned by means of large ears. The stop is nearly always made of metal, though pyramidal wood pipes have sometimes been made, usually for the 8' octave. Tonally, the Spitzfl\u00f6te is usually classified as a Flute/String hybrid, and occasionally as a Flute/Diapason hybrid. Its tone has been described as reedy or breathy, and blends very well. It has been made at every pitch from 16' to 1', including mutations; indeed, tapered pipes are frequently used for mutations because of the excellent blending quality that can be obtained. The most common pitch for the Spitzfl\u00f6te is 4', with 8' being only slightly less common. This stop has much in common with the Gemshorn, so much so that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between their pipes or even their tone. Most sources, though not all, give the Spitzfl\u00f6te a sharper, more pointed taper than the Gemshorn. The Gemshorn is often slotted, whereas Audsley warns that the Spitzfl\u00f6te must never be slotted. The Spitzfl\u00f6te typically tends more toward flute-tone than the Gemshorn. While the name Fl\u00fbte Conique is often used for this stop, it was originally used for a completely different stop. It is not clear how this stop differs from the Conical Flute.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Doppelspitzfl\u00f6te", "link": "Doppelspitzflote"}, {"name": "Fl\u00fbte \u00e0 Fuseau", "link": "FluteAFuseau"}, {"name": "Grosse Spitzfl\u00f6te", "link": "GrosseSpitzflote"}, {"name": "Julaquinte", "link": "Julaquinte"}, {"name": "Spitzfl\u00f6te C\u00e9leste", "link": "SpitzfloteCeleste"}, {"name": "Spitzfl\u00f6tenbass", "link": "Spitzflotenbass"}, {"name": "Spitzquinte", "link": "Spitzquinte"}, {"name": "Spitz Nazard", "link": "SpitzNazard"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains examples with the following distribution:", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Flute a fuseau 8', Main Swell; Washington National Cathedral, Washington D.C., USA; Skinner 1939."}, {"link": "", "name": "Flute a Point 8', Great; K K Beth Elohim Synagogue, Charleston, South Carolina, USA; Ontko 1995."}, {"link": "", "name": "Spitzpfeife 4', Manual I; St. Laurentius-Kirche, Langwarden, Germany; Kroger? 1650."}, {"link": "", "name": "Spitzpfeife 4', Hauptwerk; Metropolitan Art Space, Tokyo, Japan; Garnier 1991."}, {"link": "", "name": "Flute Pointue 4', Swell; St. Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh, Scotland; Rieger 1992.
