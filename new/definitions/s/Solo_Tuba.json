This manual stop-name (8') usually indicates either a round-toned and intense Tuba Sonora or a very brass-like and commanding Tuba Mirabilis. There are always other Tuba stops present on the same organ when such a name as this is used. Examples Solo Tuba 8' (prep.), Choir; St. Andrew's-Wesley United Church, Vancouver, BC, Canada; Casavant 1912-1997. This is the only known example. Bibliography Irwin[1]: Solo Tuba.
