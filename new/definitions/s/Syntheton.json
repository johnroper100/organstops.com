In combination with ranks of other pitches, suitably blended together, synthetic tones of an intriguing variety are originated, to which Mr. Compton applies such names as Syntheton, Baryphone, and Krummhorn. As far as the writer knows, no examples exist on this side of the Atlantic.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
