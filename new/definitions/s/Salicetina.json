Salicional\ufffd. In his entry for Salicional he describes it further: ... the salicetina 2ft. imparts to [the choir or echo divisions] a piquancy which can be obtained in no other way. It adds a \ufffdpoint of silver\ufffd to every soft combination, and is vastly superior to the usual piccolo or flautino. Good examples of the salicetina exist in the choir of the organ at the Christian Science Church, Curzon Street, Mayfair, W., by Messrs. Hill, Norman & Beard, and in the same division at St. Elizabeth's R.C. Church, Richmond. The scale of the latter at the C's is as follows: CC (2ft.) 1 3/8 in.; tenor C (1ft.), 7/8 in.; middle C (6in.) 17/32 in.; treble C (3in.), 3/8 in. Two-ninths mouth, wide slots. Wind pressure, 3 3/4 in. In his entry for Flageolet Bonavia-Hunt says that it \ufffdoccasionally occurs as a 2ft. salicet or salicetina\ufffd. Irwin also lists it, with the following description: A String stop of 2' manual pitch, resembling the Salicet in tone, but sounding so high in pitch over most of the keyboard that it is able to do little except point up the Salicional's and Salicet's tones with some additional brightness.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains only a single example:", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Salicetina 2', Swell; Town Hall, Melbourne, Australia; Hill, Norman & Beard 1929."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
