Similar to Stillgedeckt The name Singengedeckt is listed only by Irwin, and is probably a misspelling, as no examples are known. Irwin says: A stoppered wooden Flute of 16', 8', or 4' manual pitch. This variety of the Gedeckt tribe sounds with a warm, fluty, round effect on the ear that is suitable for solo playing as well as a source of fundamental to be added to other stops. The better examples of this beautiful Flute have a \ufffdsinging\ufffd quality that is really just a superior inner resonance within the structures of the pipes.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "No examples are known of the name Singengedeckt.
