According to Grove, it was popular in the 17th century in north central Germany. Wedgwood considers it equivalent to the Ranket. This reed often appears in very small practice organs as the only 16' pedal stop. The name Sertin is mentioned only by Maclean, who cites an example \ufffdat the University Church, Leipzig (Scheibe, 1715) ... a kind of Muted Trumpet\ufffd, and by Williams, who cites an 8' example \ufffdat the Paulinerkirche, Leipzig, 1715\ufffd. Both sources list it as a synonym for Sordun. There is also a flute stop that has gone by the name Sordun.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains twelve examples of Sordun, three at 32', seven at 16', one at 8', and one at 4'; all but one are known to be reeds, and that one is probably a reed also.
