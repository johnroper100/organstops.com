Locher and Wedgwood describe Suabile and Suavial as names for a soft-toned Geigenprincipal, usually of 8' pitch and starting at tenor C. Hopkins & Rimbault describe Suabe Fl\u00f6te as a wooden 4' stop with inverted mouths and a clear, liquid tone, starting at tenor C, and attributes its invention to William Hill. Grove, however, describes Suavial and Suabe Fl\u00f6te as \ufffda narrow-scaled 8' or 4' metal stop popular in southern Germany, Switzerland and the Habsburg countries from c1710 to the early 19th century.\ufffd Bonavia-Hunt calls Suabe Fl\u00f6te a 4' Clarabella, and Maclean describes it as a small-scale metal flute, sometimes harmonic. Audsley considers Suabile to be a synonym for Soave, a different stop. M. Philbert, by way of Audsley, describes Suavial as a German Swiss celeste of Salicional scale, intended to be drawn with a Flute or Bourdon, and of very soft tone that is absorbed by the stop drawn with it. The name comes from the Latin suavis, meaning \ufffdsweet\ufffd.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains a dozen and a half examples of Suavial, all at 8' except for one each at 16', 4', and 2'.
