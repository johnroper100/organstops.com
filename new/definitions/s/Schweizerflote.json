Maclean writes: \ufffdThe name has reference to a military Fife traditionally associated with the Swiss Guard Regiments.\ufffd In the 18th century, however, the name was used for a flute-string hybrid made from small-scale cylindrical or inverted conical metal pipes. It has also been used for a variety of Harmonic Flute, and as a synonym for Schweizergamba. This stop has been made at 8', 4', 2', and sometimes 1' pitch.
