Schlimbach, however, describes it as being similar to the Querpfeife in form, and voiced like the Bauerfl\u00f6te. Grove and Williams list still other forms, including conical, double cones, and overblown (harmonic). Grove dates it from 1550 in south central Germany; Williams traces it as far back as 1511. Audsley claims its name derives from the German word schweigen, meaning \ufffdto be silent\ufffd, but Grove traces its origin to the high German suegela, meaning \ufffdflute\ufffd. The instrument called schwegel was, according to Williams, a fipple flute with three finger holes. The spelling Schweigel is mentioned only by Irwin, and is almost certainly a misspelling, though a few examples do exist (see below).", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Diskantschwiegel", "link": "Diskantschwiegel"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains seventeen examples of Schwegel, two at 8' pitch, one at 1' pitch, one II-rank mixture, and the rest at 2' pitch.
