{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Stentor Horn", "origin": "English?", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Listed only by Irwin, who says: A solo lingual stop of 8' manual pitch, made from large-scale inverted-conical pipes of loud tone. It is brass-like without the freedom of vibration that can be sensed in the Trumpets. Some examples are smooth, big-toned, mellow Reeds that are useful in combination as well as for following the melody lines of the music. This stop is not to be confused with Stenthorn. According to Greek legend, Stentor was a herald in the Trojan war, described by Homer as having a voice as loud as fifty men.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
