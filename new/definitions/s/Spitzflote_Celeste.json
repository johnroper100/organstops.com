{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Spitzfl\u00f6te C\u00e9leste", "origin": "German", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Listed only by Irwin, who says: A very gentle undulating stop of quiet tone, at 8' on the manuals, sometimes called a Flute C\u00e9leste, although this term may also refer to a Dolce Flute C\u00e9leste or a Viola Flute C\u00e9leste. This c\u00e9leste, even though it is not a string c\u00e9leste, is one of the few cases among the organ's stops where a c\u00e9leste is as useful as the single rank. It is either normal-sharp or normal-flat in pitch design, a few stops being sharp-flat, but this last design denies the organist the use of a normally tuned rank of Spitzfl\u00f6te pipes, although it contrasts better with an on-pitch solo stop. The mysterious, tranquil sound that comes from this soft c\u00e9leste is heard in many church services during prayer, or when filling in the short periods between parts of the service.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Spitzflote Celeste 8', Gallery Swell; Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Newark, New Jersey, USA; Schantz 1953.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Spitzflote Celeste 8', Gallery Swell; Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Newark, New Jersey, USA; Schantz 1953."}, {"link": "", "name": "Spitzfl\u00f6te Celeste 8', Antiphonal; Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA; Ruffatti 1973."}, {"link": "", "name": "Spitzflote Celeste 8', Ancillary I; Calvary Church, Charlotte, North Carolina, USA; Moller 1990."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
