It supports the fifth harmonic, sounding approximately an E when played from a C key, seventeen scale steps higher (hence the name Seventeenth). It is therefore known as a \ufffdthird-sounding\ufffd rank. According to Grove, third-sounding ranks have been known in the organ at least as early as c1450. It was apparently first used extensively in the classical French organ, where it was a wide-scaled flute stop, usually open but sometimes (according to Williams) stopped. While Grove and Williams state that the Seventeenth was found outside France only in French-influenced organs, Adlung (writing in the mid-1700's) calls it \ufffda familiar stop in the organ\ufffd, and describes it as a principal rather than a flute. On organs of the 20th century, the Tierce is often found as part of the Great principal chorus. This rank also often appears as part of a Sesquialtera. On the theatre organ, Strony tells us that the Tierce was originally borrowed from the Concert Flute, but in modern instruments is usually taken from the Tibia. It should be noted that in classical instruments this pitch should never be borrowed from an octave-sounding rank. The harmonic it is supposed to support is too far in pitch from the nearest note in the equally-tempered scale; it can never sound properly in tune. The terms Decem and Decima are also, and more properly, used as synonyms for the Tenth. There are alternate meanings for the word Corneta. Terz is also a synonym for Third and Tenth. Regarding the name Sesquioctava, Adlung writes that it appears \ufffdat Sandomir\ufffd, and he does not understand why it is used, as the name indicates a ratio of 9/8.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Decembass", "link": "Decembass"}, {"name": "Double Tierce", "link": "Tenth"}, {"name": "Great Tierce", "link": "Tenth"}, {"name": "Gross Tierce", "link": "Tenth"}, {"name": "Grossterz", "link": "Tenth"}, {"name": "Gedeckt Tierce", "link": "GedecktTierce"}, {"name": "Harmonic Tierce", "link": "HarmonicTierce"}, {"name": "Kleinterz", "link": "Kleinterz"}, {"name": "Terzbass", "link": "Terzbass"}, {"name": "Terzfl\u00f6te", "link": "Terzflote"}, {"name": "Viol Tierce", "link": "ViolTierce"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "The most common of these names is Tierce, with over 450 examples found in Osiris.
