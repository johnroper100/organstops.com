[Royal Letters Patent, Great Britain, No. 17718. United States Patents, Nos. 457686 and 520344.] An example exists on the First Manual of the Walcker Organ in the Synagogue, Strasbourg. Irwin also lists it, saying: An open metal or wooden Flute of 8' manual pitch, yielding a loud and brilliant tone suitable for loud ensembles of flues or Reeds, and also solo playing. This Flute is less loud than the Stentorphone or Tibia Plena. It is a little louder and more brilliant than the Major Open Flute. Varieties of the stop can include smooth tones, similar to the Clarabella, or hard, hollow tones, similar to a large-scale Hohlfl\u00f6te. A few examples have two mouths per pipe [see Doppelfl\u00f6te]. According to Greek legend, Stentor was a herald in the Trojan war, described by Homer as having a voice as loud as fifty men.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples are given below.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Stentorfl\u00f6te 8', Manual I; Lutheran Trinity Church, Hainichen, Germany; Sauer 1899."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
