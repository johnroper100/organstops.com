There are examples at 32', 16', and 8'. This louder than normal form is found on the pedals at 32' and 16' and on the manuals at 8', rarely at 16'. Its open metal Diapasons do not break in pitch in many examples. It builds up a colorful, well-timbred sound of use in solo as well as countermelody playing. Pedal examples can be heard in only the larger organs, where they are valuable in creating a tone that brings up the harmonic structure to a point where it can balance the manuals. According to Greek legend, Stentor was a herald in the Trojan war, described by Homer as having a voice as loud as fifty men.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Stentor Sesquialtera VII (8', 5-1/3', 4', 3-1/5', 2-2/3', 2-2/7', 2'), Pedal; Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA; Midmer-Losh 1929-32.
