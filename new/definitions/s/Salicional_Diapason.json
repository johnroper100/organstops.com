{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Salicional Diapason", "origin": "English", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Listed only by Irwin, who says: A Foundation stop of 8' manual pitch, sounding like a bright, stringy Diapason, but without the strong fundamental heard in most Diapasons and Violin Diapasons. The scale of this hybrid between the Diapason and the Salicional is smaller than that of most other varieties of Diapason pipes. Since the Salicional itself has a little of the diminutive Foundation timbre, this union between a String and a Diapason is quite effective. It is a refined and beautiful ensemble stop for the Swell or Echo.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Salamine", "link": "Salamine"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
