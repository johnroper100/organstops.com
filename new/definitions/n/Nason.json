Grove describes its tone as sweet, and Irwin describes it as soft, round, pervading, and mysterious. It was, according to Sumner, used by North German builders during the 17th and 18th centuries, and was, according to Grove, introduced to England at the end of the 17th century by Smith. It is usually found at 4' pitch; Audsley cites one example at 1-1/3' pitch, and Irwin claims that it is found at 16' and 8' pitch as well. Irwin describes its scale as moderately large, and Bonavia-Hunt specifies a scale of 1 1/8\" by 7/8\" for the stopped 1' pipe. Bonavia-Hunt suggests that a metal Rohrfl\u00f6te \ufffdmakes a charming nason\ufffd; Irwin mentions that it is rarely made with chimneys. Maclean writes: \ufffdthe name [Nason] is also given by the present Henry Willis to a metal Chimney Flute of medium scale\ufffd. The name Nashorn is mentioned only by Sumner.
