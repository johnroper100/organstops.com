It sounds the notes three octaves and one note above the keys struck, at D5 from middle C key, and D1 from the pedal low CCC key. It is roughly in the position of the ninth harmonic of the unison series (on both manuals and pedals). It is a somewhat undiscovered source of brillianct, cymbal-like brassiness on organs. In actual practice it is seen as a small-scale, soft Diapason or Geigen Diapason. It could be a Dulciana as well. Irwin is incorrect. A properly tuned 8/9' rank will speak at exactly the ninth harmonic, and sound only very roughly a D when played from a C key.
