As the story goes, it was invented as a joke by Basile G. Austin: \ufffdNitsua\ufffd is \ufffdAustin\ufffd spelled backwards. It is made of small-scaled inverted conical open metal pipes. Its tone has been described as soft, broad, warm, and slightly keen, similar to the Dolcan but more string-like. According to Allen Miller, Austin also used the name Vox Seraphique for this stop. This name has also been used by Moller and Pilcher; it is not known whether they are similar to Austin's stop.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples are given below.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Nitsua 8'?, String Division; Irvine Auditorium, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Austin 1926."}, {"link": "", "name": "Nitsua 8'?; Bethesda-by-the-Sea, Palm Beach, Florida, USA; Austin 1999?"}, {"link": "", "name": "Nitsua II 8', Antiphonal Great; Christ Church of Oak Brook, Oak Brook, Illinois, USA; Austin.
