Till, of Philadelphia, Pa., to a labial dual stop, formed of a metal Fl\u00fbte Harmonique, 8 ft., and a metal Nasard Harmonique, 2-2/3 ft.; and introduced, for the first time, in the Concert Organ in the Wanamaker Store, in Philadelphia, Pa., where it occupies a place in the Great Organ, speaking on wind of 5 inches. This compound stop is essentially timbre-creating, yielding a tone of a remarkable quality and volume, impossible of production by a stop, however voiced, having only a single rank of pipes. The tone might well earn the stop the name Grand Quintaten, 8 ft. According to Irwin, the name Nasard Flute is synonymous with Quint Flute, though Audsley describes it differently. Regarding Grand Quintaten, Irwin says only \ufffdThe Grand Quintaten and the Nasard Flute can also be compound.\ufffd Other compound stops designed by George W. Till include Duophone, Nasard Gamba, Quint Flute, and Tierce Flute.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "No examples of", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
