At CC, it speaks at D, an octave and a whole step higher than the base stop pitch (8' or 16'). At 3 5/9' pitch it is part of the 32' harmonic series; at 7 1/9' pitch it is part of the 64' harmonic series. It is listed only by Irwin, who says: \ufffdIt is quite inharmonic in combinations, but may aid the brass stops' effect. It may be seen in some Harmonic Choruses.\ufffd This name has also been used, incorrectly, as a synonym for None.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Ninth 3 5/9', Choir-Swell; Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA; Midmer-Losh 1929-32.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Ninth 3 5/9', Choir-Swell; Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA; Midmer-Losh 1929-32."}, {"link": "", "name": "Ninth 8/9', Manual II; monastery in New Norcia, Australia; Moser 1922."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
