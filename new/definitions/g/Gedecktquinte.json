When combined with a stop of 8 ft. tone it creates the differential 16 ft. tone. Of 10-2/3 dt. pitch it belongs to the 32 ft. harmonic series, and is suitable for the Pedal Organ, where in combination with the Diapason, 16 ft., it generates the differential 32 ft. tone. These differential tones, however, are not so effective as those generated by open stops. In The Art of Organ-Building, he adds: \ufffdits harmonic-corroborating character is greatly extended when it is made of the Quintaten class\ufffd. The \ufffddifferential tones\ufffd Audsley describes are only discernable to the human ear in the lower octaves; see Resultant. Irwin also lists Gedecktquinte, saying: A large-scaled Gedeckt of 5-1/3' on the manuals, and 10-2/3' on the pedals, pitched at the third harmonic of the sub-unison series of stops. A sub-unison stop should be drawn with it.
