{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Gemshorn Celeste", "origin": "English", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Listed only by Irwin, who says: An undulating 8' Foundation c\u00e9leste on the manuals, made from two ranks of Gemshorns, sometimes of smaller than normal scale. They may be normal-sharp in pitch design, but are more useful if sharp-flat, since this enables both ranks to sound nearer the normal pitch. A slow undulation offers more uses in combinaion and accompaniment, because it causes less impairment to the timbres of all other pipes. Only the brilliant, small-scale stops are adaptable to fast undulations. The timbre of this c\u00e9leste can be clear and shining, sounding silvery in some examples. This stop is often a single off-pitch rank, intended for use with a normally pitched Gemshorn.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Numerous examples in", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
