It is formed of dish-shaped bells, spiral rods, bars, or tubes made from steel, copper or bronze, and struck by hammers actuated by a pneumatic or electric mechanism. It is usually of short compass. Skinner gives it resonators, and considers it synonymous with the Celesta, and with the Harp, but pitched an octave higher. Grove dates it from around 1720, in Swabia, Silesia and Saxony, but the earliest known example dates from 1709 (see below). According to Maclean, on theatre organs the Glockenspiel sounds a single stroke each time a key is pressed, and Bells is the same stop with a reiterating action. Campanella and Campanello are also synonyms for Campana, and Campanello is also a synonym for Chimes. There is a mixture stop which goes by the name Glockenspiel.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Bells", "link": "Bells"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains 70 examples of Glockenspiel, of which nearly all are of the percussion variety, two examples of Campanella, both of which are mixtures, two examples of Campanelli, one of which is a mixture and the other of which appears to be a percussion stop, and one example of Stahlspiel.
