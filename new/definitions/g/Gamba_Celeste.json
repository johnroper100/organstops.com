{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Gamba Celeste", "origin": "English?", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "In The Composition of the Organ, Skinner describes this stop as follows: name given two ranks of strings of great breadth and sonority, one tuned slightly sharp of the other to produce the effect of bowing characteristic of a group of orchestral strings. Both ranks consist of the type of Gamba described in [Skinner's entry for Gamba]. The scales are flared to increase the diameter at the top, as in the ancient Dolcan. The mouth is one fifth the circumference and cut up one half. The Gamba Celeste was designed exclusively for the Solo organ. Irwin has this to say: An undulating 8' String stop on the manuals composed of two ranks of Gambas. On the Solo Organ this c\u00e9leste can be quite loud and pungent, and may even rival the 'Cello Celeste in power, but it lacks that stop's warm, assertive, orchestral tone quality. It makes a very brilliant c\u00e9leste and may be heard from the Sring Organ with the Viole C\u00e9lestes. It makes a definite contrast with all other String c\u00e9lestes because it is both loud and bright-toned; most of them are soft and bright. It is useful in playing episodic passages that demand a tone of special contrast. It blends less easily than the Voix C\u00e9leste, but more easily than the Viole C\u00e9leste.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Gambette Celeste", "link": "GambetteCeleste"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains about 75 examples, the oldest of which are listed below.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Gamba Celeste 8', Swell; Cathedral Church of St John, Providence, Rhode Island, USA; Hook 1851.
