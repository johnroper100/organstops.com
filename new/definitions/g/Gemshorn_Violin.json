This combination of tones creates a stop that is useful in many ensembles. It is a good 8' base-tone for the String division, perhaps as a normal-sharp c\u00e9leste, and a suitable String for the Swell. It is a bright but rather inconspicuous accompaniment, and a source of timbre for other stops, such as the 'Cello, Keraulophone, Viola, or the open Flutes.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
