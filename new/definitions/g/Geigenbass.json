The 32' manual stop is heard on the Great of a few large organs, mostly in Europe, and then sometimes only down to tenor C (below middle C). This permits the 32', and also 16' and 8', to be available on the pedals. The 16' manual Geigen is preferred by some organists because it is uaully of better blend, being somewhat stronger harmonically than the average Diapason. This \ufffdDouble\ufffd on both manuals and pedals has a strong fundamental and never assumes the harmonic development of a Violone or Violin Diapason. Wooden pipes are sometimes seen, and they can give a superior tone. Irwin does not explain how a manual 32' stop ending at tenor C is of any use as a pedal 32' stop.Gross Geigen is listed only by Bonavia-Hunt, who says: \ufffdThe great double, 16ft., frequently found in organs built by Harrison & Harrison. It is of medium scale and slotted.\ufffd With no other information, we assume it to be a synonym for Geigenbass.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "No examples of Geigenbass are known.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Gross Geigen 16', Great; City Hall, Johannesburg, South Africa; Norman & Beard 1916."}, {"link": "", "name": "Gross Geigen 16', Great; St. Paul's Anglican Church, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Casavant 1956."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
