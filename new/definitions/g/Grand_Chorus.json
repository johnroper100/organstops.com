Even the 1/4' can be seen in both manual and pedal examples. Some examples have two or even more ranks at the same pitch to increase the sound-sources. This stop has a variety of materials and unusual patterns for breaks in the pitches, usually in the manuals, since pedal ranks are not likely to break in pitch. Occasionally the pipes are borrowed from a great variety of other stops, especially in the pedal examples.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Grand Chorus V (15 19 22 26 29), Great; Westminster Cathedral, London, England; Willis 1922-1932.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Grand Chorus V (15 19 22 26 29), Great; Westminster Cathedral, London, England; Willis 1922-1932."}, {"link": "", "name": "Grand Chorus VII (8 12 15 19 22 26 29), Bombarde; St. George's Hall, Liverpool, England; Willis."}, {"link": "", "name": "Grand Chorus IX (1 5 8 12 15 19 22 26 29), Solo; Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA; Midmer-Losh 1929-32."}, {"link": "", "name": "Grand Chorus X (-8 1 5 8 12 15 19 22 26 29), Bombarde; Liverpool Cathedral, Liverpool, England."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
