According to Praetorius it was a delicate 4' stop which sounded like a violin (geige) in the treble range when drawn with a Quintaton. Wedgwood reports that it was used as early as 1585 by Julius Antonius at St. Mary, Danzic (Gdansk), Poland. Irwin describes its tone as brilliant, light-toned, reedy, and very thin, and its resonators as short and of small diameter.
