In the Pedal of the same Organ is a stop of 16 ft. pitch labeled Grossoctavbass. Adlung has this to say: An Oktave may at times be called Grossoktave if it is the next largest after the Principal. ... The name cannot be restricted to any specific size, but is determined by the Principal. If, for example, the Principal is a 16' pitch, then 8' is the Grossoktave, 4' the ordinary [Oktave] and 2' the Superoktave. If the pedal [is based on] a 16' Principal, the 2' Oktave is often lacking; in that case the 4' is called the Superoktave and the 8' either simply the Oktave or also the Grossoktave. ...
