Its open metal (or wood) ranks add a complete chord of harmonics to any combination, solo or ensemble. Its pitches are based on the unison open-pipe partials. The lowest eight are represented. Examples on other pitch series can be formed. . . . Individual ranks in the above mixture are at different degrees of volume, perhaps also different in tone quality, in order to give the sound unity of effect. The octave-sounding ranks are louder than the other ranks, the unison ranks being the loudest. The fifth-sounding ranks are less loud, and perhaps conical in form. The third-sounding ranks are quite soft to keep them from injecting too much sharp quality. The flatted-seventh-sounding ranks are very soft, perhaps Echo Dulcianas, to keep them from being \ufffdgritty\ufffd in the ear. Audsley mentions it only in passing: \ufffdThe term grand has been applied to other stops for the purpose of indicating their relative importance; we, accordingly, find such terms as ...
