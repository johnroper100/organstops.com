This delicate, clear, silvery timbre is an ideal soft second Octave for the Great or Choir Organ. It furnishes an inconspicuous layer of overtones, without hardness or loudness, to any combination of flues. It may be derived from a Gemshorn Chorus. The name Kleingemshorn is mentioned only by Adlung, who does not define it, but only cites an example \ufffdin the palace organ at Gr\u00f6ningen\ufffd. We assume it to be a synonym. The name Klein Violn is also mentioned only by Adlung, who cites a single example of 4' pitch \ufffdin the palace at Hesse\ufffd.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples are listed below.
