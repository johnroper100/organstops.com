{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Gemshorn Mixture", "origin": "English", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Listed only by Irwin, who says: A compound manual stop designed as a mixture and made from several ranks of Gemshorns of varying loudness and hue. The Erz\u00e4hler and Conical Flutes are also sometimes used: This mixture of Foundation pipes is valuable as a tone builder, accompaniment, background, and source of separate ranks at many pitches. It sounds better without the 1-3/5' Tierce, but this might be included for a particular reason. It may be called Gemshorn Cornet when played as a solo voice, with or without the 1-3/5'. Pedal forms of compounded Gemshorns are less valuable than Diapasons.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
