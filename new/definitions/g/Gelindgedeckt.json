As its name implies, the stop, when properly scaled, and voiced under a moderate wind-pressure, yields a soft and refined tone which should be less assertive than that of a Lieblichgedeckt, inserted in the same Organ, and of the same pitch. The Gelindgedeckt, 8 ft., is a stop of great value in refined registration, especially so when its voice partakes of the tonality of the Quintaten. This desirable voice is best obtained from small-scaled wood pipes, voiced on wind of very low pressure. Audsley states that this stop was probably identical with the Musicirgedeckt, and specifies a scale of 1.78\" wide by 2.28\" deep at CC (8'), halving on the 21st pipe (1:2.3). Adlung equates it with the Musicirgedeckt and Stillgedeckt. Irwin describes it as \ufffda very soft and pure-toned Gedeckt of small scale, at 16', 8', or 4' on the manuals\ufffd.
