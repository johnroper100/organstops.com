It takes its name from the German \ufffdapfel\ufffd (apple) because of the shape of its resonators, which consisted of small globular resonators, pierced with holes, sitting atop short tubes. According to Irwin, the resonators were anywhere from 1/16 to 1/4 the normal speaking length. Seidel, by way of Audsley, gives the length of the \ufffdhead\ufffd as 4\" on the longest pipe; Adlung specifies 4\" as the length of the longest resonator. Irwin cites it as one of the oldest forms of Regal, and describes its tone as thin, whining and nasal, but not guttural, and says that the voicing has as much to do with the shape of the shallot and reed as it does with the resonator. Audsley describes the tone as muffled, and provides the illustration on the right. Wedgwood provides the illustration on the left, and lists Kopfregal as a synonym; Adlung and Audsley list Knopfregal as a synonym.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
