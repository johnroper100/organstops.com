It was sometimes made without resonators, as with the Physharmonika, or with small bells or conical resonators. According to Wedgwood, it had thin, narrow tongues, and its tone resembled a soft Oboe. Grove dates it from around 1815. While Seidel and Hamel describe it as being imitative of the aeolian harp, Bonavia-Hunt says that the aeoline was \ufffda form of accordian introduced by Wheatstone before the concertina\ufffd.
