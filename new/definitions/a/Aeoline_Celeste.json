It is almost too soft to be in the String Organ, except in a building where it can be heard. Its shimmering, delicate sound may be heard from the Choir, the off-pitch rank being removable. It is background and accompaniment tone, not making an effective sound unless chorded, perhaps with the intramanual 4' coupler.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "There are eight single-rank examples in Osiris, and one three-rank example that is also the earliest known example:", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Aeoline Celeste III 8, Echo I; Cadet Chapel, United States Military Academy, West Point, NY, USA; Moller."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
