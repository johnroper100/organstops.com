Because, as has just been mentioned, it is often the same as Scharf, the name Cymbelscharf is also found, for example in the Kreuzkirche in Dresden, where there is also a separate Scharf as well. Thus it must sound like a Cymbel, or there is some other distinction, or they do not stand on the same manual. There is indeed a Scharf Cymbel at St. Petri in L\ufffdbeck, as well as at the Kirche zu Unsrer Lieben Frau there; see Praetorius. In the Pfarrkirche organ at K\u00f6nigsberg this Cymbelscharf is actually 4 ranks, but [only] 3 ranks at St. Dominicus in Prague, the usual size at which the Cymbel is found. Sumner says only \ufffdsometimes a four- or five-rank stop, known as Zymbel-scharf, was made.\ufffd Irwin mentions Scharfzimbel in a list of mixture stops under the heading \ufffdDiapason Chorus\ufffd, with no definition; we assume it to be a synonym.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples of Scharfcymbel and Scharfzimbel are given below.
