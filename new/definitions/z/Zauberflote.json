Its name means \ufffdmagic flute\ufffd, after the Mozart opera of the same name. A stopped harmonic pipe has a length three times that of a normal stopped pipe speaking the same pitch. Wedgwood, who provides the illustration reproduced here, describes the tone of the Zauberfl\u00f6te as full, liquid and pure, with a \ufffdsuspicion of stringiness\ufffd. Irwin reports that the pipes have very large ears for stabilizing the tone and for tuning, but this was not a feature of Thynne's original stop. Bonavia-Hunt provides the following description of the original: From tenor C to top, the pipes are stopped, three times the normal length, and overblown to speak the twelfth. Wood is used from tenor C to E (five notes), and the remainder of the stop from tenor F is of metal. The scale of the tenor C pipe is 2 3/4 in. by 2 1/8 in., its length being 33 1/2 in. from the block. A node-hole, 1/16 in. in diameter, is pierced at a distance of nine-sixteenths of the speaking length of the pipe from the upper lip. The scale of the mid. C note (treb. C note) is 1 15/16 in., its length being 16 3/4 in. from the upper lip, with the node-hole in the same relative position. The mouth is two-ninths in width, and cut up a fourth of its width. Audsley claims that the Zauberfl\u00f6te is of greatest value at 4' pitch, and indeed that seems to be the most common pitch (see examples below). He provides a description of the last example voiced by Thynne, also at 4' pitch, in St. John's Church, Richmond, Surrey, England:", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Fl\u00fbte Bouch\u00e9e Harmonique", "link": "FluteBoucheeHarmonique"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains five examples at 8' pitch, eleven at 4', and seven at 2'.
