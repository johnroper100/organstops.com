In The Art of Organ-Building, however, he cites Seidel as attributing its invention to the German builder Tobias Turley (1773-1829), a claim supported by Wedgwood. Turley originally named his stop Gamba, but renamed it to Zartfl\u00f6te at the request of Musikdirektor Wilke, after the German word zart meaning \ufffddelicate\ufffd. First introduced as an 8' stop in the organ in the Marienkirche, Wismar, Germany, it had small-scale open wood pipes and a tone that Wedgwood calls a hybrid of a Flute and a Fugara, and Audsley calls \ufffdextremely tender\ufffd. In the late 1860's Edmund Schulze used the name in his organ in the Church of St. Bartholomew, Armley, England for a small-scale conical metal stop with a wooden bass. According to Audsley it had \ufffdan extremely soft and refined flute-tone\ufffd, but Bonavia-Hunt calls it a small-scaled Gemshorn, almost exactly the same as Schulze's Fernfl\u00f6te at St. Mary's, Tyne Dock, England. The stop was re-invented in 1896 by J. W. Whiteley, who described it (as quoted by Audsley) thus: This stop is a modification of the Quintaten, with every suggestion of tonal coarseness removed. It bears the same relation to the ordinary Quintaten that a very refined Dulciana or Salicional does to an Open Diapason, the result being a light and bright flute-tone, with sufficient reedy quality to give it a distinctive character.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Zartgedeckt", "link": "Zartgedeckt"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains seven examples of Zartfl\u00f6te at 8' pitch, and ten at 4'.
