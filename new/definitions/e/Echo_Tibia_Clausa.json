It has the \ufffdpure\ufffd fundamental of its larger-scaled counterpart, but not its \ufffdsweetness\ufffd or intensity of tone. However, the tone quality of this Tibia is somewhat liquid and smooth, without any obvious third harmonic. High cut-up, leathered or leaded lips, thick, smooth walls, and beveled mouths make this Echo Tibia a useful solo tone on the Swell, Solo, or Echo. Flautino may be the 2' pitch.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
