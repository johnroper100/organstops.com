It sounds almost pure fundamental, and can furnish this ground tone to such soft stops as the Echo Gamba, Dulciana, or Dolcan. It is a poor accompaniment stop because its pitch is not apparent even to listeners close to the organ.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Echo Gedeckt 8', Echo Pedal; St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York City, USA; Kilgen 1930.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Echo Gedeckt 8', Echo Pedal; St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York City, USA; Kilgen 1930."}, {"link": "", "name": "Echo Gedeckt 16', Gallery Echo Pedal; First Congregational Church, Los Angeles, California, USA; Skinner/Schlicker/Moller 1995."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
