It has none of the muted sound, since this would dampen the number of harmonics in the tone. This is the complete 'Cello tone, except that it is at piano instead of mezzo forte. However, it is only natural that a few harmonics at the top of the train will disappear as the stop becomes softer, but these may make little difference. Either wood or metal pipes may be seen in this stop.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
