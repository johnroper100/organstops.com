{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Euphonium", "origin": "English", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Most sources consider this name to be a synonym for Euphone. Skinner, however, lists the two names separately, describing Euphonium as \ufffdthe name sometimes given a 16' or 8' manual or pedal reed. Obsolete in America.\ufffd Irwin claims that Euphone and Euphonium are not synonymous, and describes the latter as \ufffdindicating the large orchestral Tuba\ufffd. This is incorrect on two counts: the instrument known as Euphonium is a tenor or baritone tuba, and is a band instrument, not an orchestral instrument. Similar to the baritone horn, it is a member of the saxhorn family, invented in the 1840's by Adolphe Sax. Irwin may have been confused by the Wanamaker Euphonium.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples are given below.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Euphonium 8', Pedal; Albert Hall, Nottinghamshire, England; Binns 1909."}, {"link": "", "name": "Euphonium 16', Main Pedal; John Wanamaker Store, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
