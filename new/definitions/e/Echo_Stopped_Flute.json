{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Echo Stopped Flute", "origin": "English", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Listed only by Irwin, who says: A wooden or metal Flute of various shades of color, sounding at 8' or 4' on the manuals. It is usually designed as a small-scale Gedeckt, although large-scale Gedeckts can also be very soft. It is softer than the Echo Open Flute, having but half that Flute's harmonic train. It is a useful but soft Copula. It can add the prime tone to any soft stop, such as the Echo Gamba or Dolcan. It is a poor accompaniment. It may be a Fernfl\u00f6te or Echo Flute, or even a soft Doppelgedeckt.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
