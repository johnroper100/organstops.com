This neutral-toned and somewhat bright stop makes a good accompaniment for either vocal or organ solo. A single 4' Erz\u00e4hler rank added to this c\u00e9leste increases its usefulness with the louder solo stops, since it gives more pitch-support and a little more penetration.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Numerous examples in", "examples": [], "soundClips": [{"divisionName": "", "clips": [{"files": [{"name": "Arpeggio", "file": "ErzahlerCelesteArpeg.mp3"}, {"name": "St. Anne", "file": "ErzahlerCelesteStAnne.mp3"}], "name": ">Erz\u00e4hler C\u00e9leste 8', Choir", "organLink": "CulverAcademy", "organName": "Culver Academies, Indiana, USA", "organBuilderName": "M\u00f6ller 1951"}]}], "bibliography": []}
