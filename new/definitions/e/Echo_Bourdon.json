Audsley reports that the Echo Bourdon differs widely from the Lieblich Gedeckt \ufffdon account of the different proportions and treatment of the mouths of its pipes, and, accordingly, in a special style of voicing.\ufffd He describes the tone of the Bourdonecho as \ufffdhumming\ufffd, as opposed to the \ufffdcovered\ufffd tone of the Lieblich Gedeckt. He recommends a wind pressure of 1 1/2\" to 2 1/2\", not to exceed 3\", and that the pipes be made of oak or maple, \ufffdfinished as thin as conditions will permit\ufffd.
