This stop enters into combination with any other flue stop, and is an ideal soft accompaniment, perhaps for an Echo Oboe or Orchestral Flute stop. It is formed like the bigger Gemshorn.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
