{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Echo Violin", "origin": "English", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Listed only by Irwin, who says: A String of soft orchestral tone color, at 8' on the manuals, representing the Viole d'Orchestre in timbre, but in softer form. The incisive brilliance, keenness, and cutting tone quality of the orchestral String stops are all present in this stop, but greatly reduced in intensity, because making any bright stop an Echo stop automatically wipes out of existence some of its highest-pitched overtones. This, in turn, limits the dissonance in the tone, without damaging the basic color of the timbre. Its prime tone (fundamental) is inaudible, and the fourth harmonic the loudest component, as in many bright Strings. This stop is brighter and softer than the Muted Violin and Aeoline.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
