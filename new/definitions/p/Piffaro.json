Audsley describes it as imitative of the orchestral flute; Adlung and Wedgwood simply list it as a synonym for Flauto Traverso. Grove supports this definition, dating it from the 16th century, and stating that in later times it was made with double mouths. Grove also lists an alternate definition: An important Italian stop of the 16th century onwards; it had treble compass Principal-scaled pipes mistuned with the Principale 8' and thus producing an undulating effect (Schwebung), more singing and less reedy than 19th-century c\u00e9leste stops. It was sometimes called Voce umana. Williams places the Italian celeste form of Piffaro in 18th-century Portugal and \ufffdItalianate Catholic\ufffd areas of Germany. Maclean claims that the Voce Umana is a flute celeste, and that Piffaro has also been used as a synonym for Schalmei or Piffero (a claim supported by Adlung). The name Voce Umana is also a synonym for Vox Humana, and Piffaro has been used as a synonym for Bifara. According to Williams, the names Piffaro and Fiffaro derive from pfeife or fife, or vice versa. The piffero was an Italian reed instrument of the shawm type.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains nineteen examples of Piffaro.
