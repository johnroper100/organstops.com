The Nasat ... is in the opinion of some the same thing; see the Anleitung, p. 436, note (m), where I have mentioned that Gregorius Vogel calls the stopped Quinte 3' a Pfeiferfl\ufffdte. Since the Nasat is neither always stopped nor always a Quinte, it would be better to consider each of these as a separate stop. The only other reference we have to this stop-name is from Seidel-Kothe, by way of Audsley: \ufffdPfeiferfl\u00f6te wird zuweilen Nasat 2-2/3' genannt.\ufffd (\ufffdPfeiferfl\u00f6te is called occasionally Nasat 2-2/3'.\ufffd)", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
