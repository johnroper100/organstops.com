Its tone is more or less suggestive of the orchestral instrument of the same name; when intended to be truly imitative, it may be called Orchestral Piccolo, and some authorities consider the names to be synonymous. It may be of harmonic construction, even when not explicitly named Harmonic Piccolo. The name is occasionally, and incorrectly, used for a stopped rank. Maclean considered it identical to the Flageolet, Flautina, Hellpfeife, and Octavin. Grove dates it from the 19th century, though one example apparently dates from 1660 (see below). On theatre organs, according to Strony, the name Piccolo is used very inconsistently, and may be drawn from either a Tibia Clausa or a Flute rank. The name Zwergpfeife is mentioned only by Wedgwood, who says only \ufffdsee Piccolo\ufffd. The word zwerg is German for \ufffddwarf\ufffd.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Harmonic Piccolo", "link": "HarmonicPiccolo"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains about 250 examples of Piccolo, three quarters of which are at 2' pitch.
