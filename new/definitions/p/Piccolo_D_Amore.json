It is a softly-voiced flute-toned stop of 2 ft. pitch, properly formed of half-covered wood pipes of small scale, from CC to C2, and thence to top note in small-scale open metal pipes, preferably of Spitzfl\u00f6te form. Irwin also lists it, saying: A soft, half-covered Flute of 2' manual pitch, which is sometimes given the structure of a Fl\u00fbte d'Amour: small-scale rectangular wooden pipes with narrow brass rohrs in their stoppers. Its refined and gentle tone is useful in the Choir Organ, perhaps the Echo.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains only a single example:", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Piccolo d'Amore 2', Echo; St. Matthew's Lutheran Church, Hanover, Pennsylvania, USA; Austin 1925."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
