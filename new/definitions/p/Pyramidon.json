Audsley and Sumner give the speaking length of this pipe as 2' 6\"; it is not clear whether the 3\" difference constitutes the height of the block, or resulted from a typographical error.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
