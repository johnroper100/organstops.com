Beale & Thynne and by Mr. J. W. Whiteley to the flat rank of a II rank (flat and sharp) Viole C\u00e9leste. There is no adequate reason why such ranks should not simply be described as flat or sharp. Such terminology is more prosaic perhaps, but less confusing. Examples Violons Celestes I-II 8', Solo; City Hall, Hull, England; Forster & Andrews 1911.
