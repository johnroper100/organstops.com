{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Vox Humana Regal", "origin": "(hybrid)", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Listed only by Irwin, who says: A short-resonator Reed at 8' or 4' on both manuals and pedals. It is intensely brilliant, although moderately soft. It combines the reedy, windy effect of the Regals and the guttural tone of the Vox Humana. Its functions include those of most Regals, but especially the contrasting effect needed by manual and pedal line of notes against the smoother flue stops, like the Diapason and Flutes.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
