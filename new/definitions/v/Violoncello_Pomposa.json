This rich, resonant, big-toned, stringy timbre has a few more overtones in it than the average 'Cello stop. It is one of the loudest Strings in the organ. It may be on the Solo or String windchest, and may make the loudest c\u00e9leste in the organ. It is usually made fropm metal pipes but wood provides an equally loud, deep, bright-toned effect if the rank is so designed.
