Compared to the Viole C\u00e9leste, made from cylindrical pipes of about the same scale, this is a slightly softer c\u00e9leste, and one of more fragile tone quality. It is not so generally useful as the Viole C\u00e9leste, or Voix C\u00e9leste made from Salicional pipes. It lacks the warm quality of timbre noted in many c\u00e9lestes of Strings. It is solely on the brilliant side, and not even pungent nor particularly orchestral in tone. It can be tuned to any of the pitch-patterns of a c\u00e9leste but normal-sharp gives a normal rank for other combinations. Chorded and with couplers it makes an opaque mass of tone which surprises the listener by being bright but not very loud.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
