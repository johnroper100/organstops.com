{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Viola Phonon", "origin": "Unknown", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Listed only by Irwin, who says: A solo String stop of 8' manual pitch, with a tone quality that is typical of the Viola tribe of stops, except that this stop sounds broader and a little richer in harmonics than most Violas. Compared to the Viola Pomposa, this stop has more fundamental and fewer overtones. Although it is loud for a String, it can combine with Flute, Foundation, and other String stops. It is never cutting or keen in tone. A Viola may be given this tone without the use of this name.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Viola Phonon 8', String Organ II; Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA; Midmer-Losh 1929-32.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Viola Phonon 8', String Organ II; Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA; Midmer-Losh 1929-32."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
