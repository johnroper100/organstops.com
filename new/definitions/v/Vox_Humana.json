A reed stop of the Regal class, it has been made in a wide variety of forms, including (according to Audsley) a free-reed. However, throughout the centuries it has most often employed cylindrical resonators, usually 1/4 or 1/8 length, and usually partially or fully capped. A typical form is shown in Audsley's illustration reproduced here (click on it for a larger image). It is arguably the only stop to survive, in its original form, through the symphonic excesses of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The tone of the Vox Humana is not particulary unique; other Regals produce similar sounds. Its name, however, establishes a tonal goal which has caused countless critics to write it off as unsuccessful or even laughable. While organ builders have tried for half a millenium to imitate the human voice, the most successful attempts only manage to approximate the sound of a male chorus singing in the distance. It has been often stated that the most important stop in any organ is the room into which it speaks, and the Vox Humana epitomizes this principle. The success or failure of this stop depends not so much on the details of its construction, but rather on its acoustical environment. A large, reverberant room, distance from the listener, and enclosure in a swell box all contribute greatly to its effect. A tremulant is also essential, which must be carefully adjusted. The Voix Humaine was a standard voice in the Grand Orgue division of the French Classic organ, where it was always used with the 8' Bourdon and the tremblant doux, and often with the 4' Flute as well. No theatre organ could be considered complete without at least one Vox Humana; some consider it to be as important as the Tibia Clausa. Larger instruments might have as many as four independent Vox Humana ranks. According to Strony, the finest ones were made by Wurlitzer, who made a few Vox Humana choruses with separate 16, 8, 4 ranks, and even a celeste!", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Double Vox Humana", "link": "DoubleVoxHumana"}, {"name": "Echo Vox Humana", "link": "EchoVoxHumana"}, {"name": "Jungfernregal", "link": "Jungfernregal"}, {"name": "Major Vox Humana", "link": "SoloVoxHumana"}, {"name": "Minor Vox Humana", "link": "MinorVoxHumana"}, {"name": "Pilgerchor", "link": "Pilgerchor"}, {"name": "Solo Vox Humana", "link": "SoloVoxHumana"}, {"name": "Viejas/Viejos", "link": "Viejos"}, {"name": "Virginregal", "link": "Jungfernregal"}, {"name": "Vox Humana Krummhorn", "link": "VoxHumanaKrummhorn"}, {"name": "Vox Humana Regal", "link": "VoxHumanaRegal"}, {"name": "Vox Humana Schalmei", "link": "VoxHumanaSchalmei"}, {"name": "Vox Pueri/Tauri", "link": "VoxPueri"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains iver 500 examples of Vox Humana, 13 of which are at 16', 9 at 4', and the rest at 8'; two of the latter have II ranks.
