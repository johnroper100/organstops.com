Williams adds that it was used for a variety of soft high-pitched reed stops in 18th century Germany. In the 19th century the name was used for various soft-toned flue stops. It is considered by some writers to be the softest stop in the organ. It is often made as a type of Dulciana, and may or may not be a celeste.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains 75 examples of Vox Angelica, all at 8' pitch except for a handful at 4'.
