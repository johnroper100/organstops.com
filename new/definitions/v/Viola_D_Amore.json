Audsley calls it the softest and sweetest of the imitative string stops; others have called its tone \ufffdrefined\ufffd. Its open metal pipes are usually cylindrical with harmonic bridges. According to Audsley, they are sometimes conical, and sometimes with a slotted bell, and the 8' and 4' octaves may be straight or pyramidal wood. Skinner describes them as conical, with a reedy tone, but Irwin claims they are sometimes slightly inverted conical. Wedgwood's entire description reads: \ufffdpractically identical with Echo Gamba, but sometimes a slightly sharp-toned Dulciana.\ufffd Maclean considers it practically identical with the Salicional. Audsley provides the illustration reproduced here (which Irwin copied without credit) which shows a tenor C pipe made by Henri Zimmermann for Audsley's own chamber organ. Williams dates Viol d'Amour (which we assume to be a synonym) from 1737 at Friedrichsstadt, Germany. Other stops which claim to be the softest are Dolcissimo, Echo Dulciana Celeste, Echo Gamba, Fernfl\u00f6te, Vox Angelica, and Vox Mystica.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "The following examples are the oldest ones listed in Osiris.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Viola d'Amore 4', Canto; Nostra Signora della Consolazione Genova, Italy; Locatelli 1880."}, {"link": "", "name": "Viola d'Amore 8', Manual IV; Dom, Schwerin, Germany; Ladegast 1871."}, {"link": "", "name": "Viola d'Amore 8', Manual III; Johanniskirche, Wernigerode, Germany; Ladegast 1885."}, {"link": "", "name": "Viola d'Amour 8', Choir; Congregational Church, Great Barrington, Massachusetts, USA; Roosevelt 1883."}, {"link": "", "name": "Viola d'Amour 8', Oberwerk; Cathedral, Riga, Latvia; Walcker 1883."}, {"link": "", "name": "Viole d'Amour 4', Recit; Parr Hall, Warrington, England; Cavaill\u00e9-Coll 1875."}, {"link": "", "name": "Viole d'AMour 4', Recit; Saint Ouen, Rouen, France; Cavaill\u00e9-Coll 1890."}, {"link": "", "name": "Liebesgeige 8', Oberwerk; Dreifaltigkeitskirche, Liepaja/Libau, Latvia; Gr\u00fcneberg 1885."}, {"link": "", "name": "Liebesgeige 4', Zungenschwellwerk; St. Michaelis, Hamburg, Germany; Walcker 1912 (destroyed)."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
