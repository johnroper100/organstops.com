Bonavia-Hunt claims that it is made from Viola ranks, and was first introduced by Thynne. Wedgwood considers it to be a synonym for Voix C\u00e9leste; Skinner describes it as two ranks of Salicional or Viole d'Orchestre. Irwin, who gives the synonym String Celeste, claims that it is made from Viole d'Orchestre or Muted Violin ranks, and describes its tone as brilliant, keen and cutting. In his entry for Celeste, he lists Viole d'Orchestre as one of the stops from which celestes have been made, but does not make it clear whether the name Viole d'Orchestre C\u00e9leste has ever been used. Strony lists Viol Celeste as a celeste rank intended to be used with the Viol d'Orchestre, presumably a rank of similar construction and tone. It is found in at 16', 8' and 4' pitch.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "The Viole C\u00e9leste is a fairly common stop, with over 100 examples listed in Osiris.
