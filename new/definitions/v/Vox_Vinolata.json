Vinolentus = drunken. (Vinolata is very bad Latin.) A small-scaled Gemshorn of weak intonation. Lund Cathedral, Sweden. How the stop came to receive so extraordinary a name is not known. It is not a Vox Humana. Commenting on the Vox Vinolata, the editors of The Organist and Choirmaster propounded the delightful suggestion that it might well be utilized as a stock object lesson in \ufffdTemperance Hall\ufffd organs. Audsley also lists it, saying: A very remarkable name given to a labial stop, of 8 ft. pitch, the pipes of which are of metal and conical in form, resembling the Spitzfl\u00f6te. The apparently unique example of the stop exists in the Organ in the Cathedral of Lund, Sweden. Audsley then quotes Seidel in a footnote: Vox Vinolata, 8' von Metall, spitz aufw\u00e4rts, von enger Mensur und schwacher Intonation, ist ein Fl\u00f6tenwerk im 3 (Ober-) Manual der Domorgel zu Lund. Wie der Ausdruck vinolata zu einem Orgelregister passt, d\u00fcrfte schwer zu entr\u00e4tseln sein. Here is an English translation: Vox Vinolata, 8' of metal, pointedly upward, of narrow scale and weak intonation, is a flute stop in the third (upper) manual of the cathedral organ at Lund. How the term vinolata fits an organ register, might be difficult to explain.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
