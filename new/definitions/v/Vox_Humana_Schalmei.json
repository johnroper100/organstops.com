{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Vox Humana Schalmei", "origin": "Latin/German", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Listed only by Irwin, who says: A short-resonator Reed at 8' or 4' on both manuals and pedals. Its tone quality is a hybrid between the bright, nasal, acid timbre of the Schalmei, and the thin, indistinctly pitched Vox Humana. It is less brilliant than the Schalmei, and more substantial in tone than the Vox Humana. Its harmonically rich, piping, intense tone can be used in combination for contrasts in countermelodies or combined with flue stops for the same function, or even as a solo stop.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "None known.", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
