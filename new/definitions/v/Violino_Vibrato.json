The distinctive peculiarity of this stop lies in its being tuned a few beats sharp, so as to produce a wavering effect when sounded in combination with a correctly tuned unison string-toned stop. As the Violino Vibrato occupies a similar place in the tonal scheme of the Organ to the Violoncello Vibrato, its offices in the stop-apportionment of the Ancillary String Organ may be considered identical.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Violino Vibrato 8', String Organ; Memorial Auditorium, Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA; Austin 1925.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Violino Vibrato 8', String Organ; Memorial Auditorium, Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA; Austin 1925."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
