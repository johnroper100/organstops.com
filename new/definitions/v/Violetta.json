Audsley maintains that the Violetta is of small scale with an imitative tone of medium strength. Sumner describes it as a 4' Viol, while Irwin considers it to be a synonym for Octave Violin. Williams gives the following definitions, with which Grove concurs: I Spanish regal, very often horizontal, with short open conical resonators and a tone like a soft trumpet (18th-cent. cathedrals). At Segovia Cathedral (P. de Echevarr\u00eda, 1796), Violin was the bass half and Violeta the treble half of a horizontal regal-stop.
