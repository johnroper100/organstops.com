Irwin describes it as follows: An undulating stop of mild String tone, at 8' on the manuals, and made from two ranks of Viola pipes, perhaps of different scale for a variety of effect. The off-pitch rank may be smaller and brighter to make the c\u00e9leste beat a little more in the higher overtones. Or one rank may be of wood and one of metal, or one of tin and one of spotted metal. This is a milder c\u00e9leste than most String c\u00e9lestes and is very suitable for accompaniment and background playing.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains dozens of examples, mostly single ranks, but a few with two ranks.
