{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Violoncello Vibrato", "origin": "Italian", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Audsley lists this stop with the following description: A stop, of 8 ft. pitch, similar in the form and scale of its pipes to the Violoncello, but slightly softer in tone; properly occupying, in this respect, an intermediate place between the Violoncello and the Violoncello Sordo. The distinctive peculiarity of the stop under consideration lies in its being tuned slightloy sharp as to produce a wavering effect when sounded in combination with a correctly tuned unison string-toned stop, preferably the Violoncello Sordo, imitating as closely as possible under the conditions, the effect of the vibrato on the orchestral Violoncello. Drawn with such stops as the Viola Sorda, Viole Sourdine, or Viola d'Amore, it forms an effective Violoncelle C\u00e9leste. Irwin lists it with this description: A single rank of 8' manual 'Cello pipes, of less than averae loudness and harmonic development (brightness). Like the one-rank Aeolina and Unda Maris, this stop may be used to make a c\u00e9leste with such ranks as the Nachthorn, Dolce, Salicional, Dulciana, Gemshorn, Viola, Erz\u00e4hler, or normally tuned 'Cello. It is more usable if of slower undulation, because the other rank with which it will be combined will probably be somewhat dull.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains but a single example:", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Violoncello Vibrato 8', String Organ; Memorial Auditorium, Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA; Austin 1925."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
