(The ordinary Oboe is usually not imitative.) This stop has been made in a number of forms, nearly always as a reed, but sometimes as a flue. George Willis is credited with the invention of this stop, and the form used by him is described by Audsley as follows: The resonators are of an extremely slender inverted conical form, devoid of bells, and having closed upper ends and long and narrow slots adjoining them. This form of resonator is shown in [the illustration reproduced here], which is drawn from the Willis Orchestral Oboe in the Organ in the Town Hall, Huddersfield. The reeds or \u00e9schalotes are of very small scale, and have their stopped ends formed at an acute angle upward from the lower edge of their faces. The tongues or languettes are very narrow, of good substance, and finely curved, as usual in all Willis reeds. Bonavia-Hunt describes two other reed forms: One method is to utilise the normal oboe tube and bell, and considerably reduce the scale of both. The shallot is likewise reduced in scale, with a mere saw-cut openint, the base being sloped backward. This form of shallot can be used in all three types here described, and is known as the orchestral oboe shallot. The scaling of the Walker orchestral oboe (which is made according to this pattern) is as follows: CC (8ft.), 2 9/16 in. at the top of the bell, 1 1/16 in at the bottom; tenor C (4 ft.), 1 15/16 in. at the top of the bell, 3/4 in. at the bottom. The bells are half-capped, and have a small hole pierced about midway between the top and the bottom of the bell. The third variety is that advocated by the late Mr. J. M. Boustead, who adopted it, as the result of many experiments, in his large chamber organ at Westfield, Wimbledon Common, now removed and used as material for two separate organs. Mr. Boustead tookan ordinary oboe pipe and cut the tube down to a third its length, making the middle C (2ft.) pipe about 8in. long and the tenor C (4 ft.) pipe about 1ft. 4in. long. The diameter of the tenor C pipe thus cut down would be about 5/8 in. Aboce treble C (1 ft.), the third length becomes too short for practical purposes and the pipes have to be made harmonic, - that is, two-thirds the normal oboe length. Adjustable caps are, of course, necessary for regulation. Skinner describes his own Orchestral Oboe as follows: This follows the physical and acoustical form of its namesake fairly closely. Its shallot is very slender and sharply beveled at its lower extremity. The openings are narrow and the tongues thin. The resonators are slender and capped. While the open valves of the orchestral instrument determine the pitch of their associated tube length, they do not cancel the qualifying effect on the tone. To parallel this effect in the organ pipe, we cap the top ande cut the tuning slot well below the cap. This forms a pocket which contributes a sympathetic glow or sweetness to an otherwise acid tone. The orchestral instrument has a single tube for all the notes. The diameter of the tubes is therefore relatively larger for each note in going up the scale, since it remains constant, while the length becomes shorter. This results in a gradual change in quality in going up or down the scale. In developing an equivalent voice for the organ, this progressive change in character must be provided. The scale of pipes is therefore modified in going from one end of the group to the other, as is necessary in the development of all orchestral voices for the organ.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains over 100 examples of Orchestral Oboe, five examples of Orchestral Hautboy, and four of Hautbois d'Orchestre, all of the latter dating from the 20th century.
