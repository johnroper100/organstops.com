It may be tuned as a complex c\u00e9leste, or all pipes may be at the normal pitch. Each rank may have its own stop key, or they may all be controlled by a group key. This is a favorite residence organ stop as well as concert and theater organ stop. The more realistic specimens are not too loud and have a moderately slow undulation.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "All known examples are given below.", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Orchestral Strings II 8' #1-#4, String Ensemble; Woolsey Hall, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA; Skinner 1928.
