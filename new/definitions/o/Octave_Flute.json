The loudness of its fundamental and the prominence of its overtones are both voiced to sound well with other stops of the division. The pedal rank is larger, louder, and more prominent than the manual's. The form os this stop may be with a beveled lip, like the Clarabella or Major Open Flute, or inverted lip, like the Melodia or Hohlfl\u00f6te. Audsley mentions it in passing, with no definition other than its octave pitch.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains over two dozen examples, all but one at 4' pitch:", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Octave Flute 2', Solo; Crystal Cathedral, Garden Grove, California, USA; Ruffati."}], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
