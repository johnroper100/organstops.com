{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Orchestral Piccolo", "origin": "English", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Audsley describes this stop as follows: An open labial stop of metal or wood, sometimes of both, formed, in the finest examples, of harmonic pipes. It is of 2 ft. pitch; and is voiced to yield bright and piercing flute-tones, imitative of those of the orchestral Flauto Piccolo. As the Orchestral Piccolo, 2 ft., is simply an Octave of the Orchestral Flute of 4 ft. pitch, its pipes are constructed in precisely the same manner. The Orchstral Piccolo being, in its proper form, a solo stop, the scale of its pipes should be similar to, or perhaps two pipes smaller than, the scale of the corresponding octaves of the Orchestral Flute. The stop should be of harmonic pipes throughout, the wood pipes extending from the bottom note to e2, and metal ones from f2 to the top. There will be an advantage in the matter of construction, and no disadvantage in tonal effect, attending this arrangement; for in notes of so high a pitch, the tones from wood are not in any way superior to those produced from metal pipes. Irwin lists it as a synonym for Piccolo.
