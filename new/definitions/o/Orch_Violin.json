(That instrument was later moved to Tewksbury Abbey.) Audsley considered it a near-perfect imitation of the orchestral violin. Ironically, there is no such instrument called \ufffdviole d'orchestre\ufffd; the French call the orchestral violin violon. Thynne's scale for this stop varied from 2-3/4\" to 1-1/2\" at 8' C. Later builders used even smaller scales, down to 1-1/16\". Audsley specifies a 2/9 to 1/3 mouth, cut up 1/4 to 1/3. The Orchestral Violin is commonly considered to be the keenest string stop in the organ, producing the highest upper frequency content obtainable from flue pipes. It is invariably found at 8' pitch, except on some theatre organs which unify it to other pitches. It was most popular in the first half of the 20th century.
