It has almost twice the number of partials as its orchestral counterpart, and a louder sound. Some examples are of only moderate power and quite light in tone, depending upon the other stops in the organ. This Trumpet has the maximum of clang-tone and number of upper partials, as well as the exponentially shaped resonators of solid brass to project them into space. These resonators are also well polished and do not absorb the great number of very soft, high-pitched components the inverted-conical pipes of the Trompette do. Therefore, these high but soft partials are allowed to escape the pieps and are more likely to reach the ears of the listener. It is the most brilliant but not the loudest Reed in the organ. Many examples are still playing throughout the country, and most are known as Gottfried Trumpets in honor of Anton Gottfried, who built many of these stops. Audsley implies that the Orchestral Trumpet is not a chorus reed, and describes its tone as \ufffdsingularly bright, silvery, and jubilant\ufffd, and specifying that it be voiced \ufffdto imitate as closely as possible the characteristic tones of the orchestral instrument.\ufffd Grove describes Feldtrompete as \ufffdthe German imitative trumpet, not en chamade as in Spain but often held in the case vertically; others were interior trumpets, all of a thin, strong tone.\ufffd Grove claims that Feldpfeife is also a synonym, but we believe this to be sloppy copy-editing. Feldtrompete may also be a synonym for Field Trumpet.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Muted Trumpet", "link": "MutedTrumpet"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains fourteen examples of and Feldtrompete, two at 8' pitch and the rest at 4'; thirteen examples of Orchestral Trumpet all at 8' pitch except for one each at 16' and 4'; and seven examples of Brass Trumpet, most on Wurlitzer theatre organs, and all at 8' pitch.
