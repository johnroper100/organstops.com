It is a reed stop of the Regal class; Grove calls it \ufffdthe predecessor of regal stops with fanciful resonators\ufffd. Williams calls the B\u00e4rpfeife \ufffda successor to the old regal or reed Schreyerpfeife\ufffd, and is the only source to mention the latter name. Adlung cites Werckmeister as stating that around 1600 the B\u00e4rpfeife and Krummhorn were called Vox Humana. According to the literature it has been made at 32', 16', 8', and 4' pitch, but the only known examples are at 8'. It has been made with a variety of resonator shapes. The most common consisted of two truncated cones joined at the base, as shown Wedgwood's illustration above (click on it for a larger image). Often an additional truncated cone was added to the top, as shown in Audsley's drawing below.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "No examples of Schreyer or Kryther are known; those synonyms are listed only by Grove.
