The organ stop of the same name is most commonly an imitative reed stop similar to the Clarinet, found at 8' pitch and occasionally 16'. Though a few sources consider the Bassethorn to be synonymous with the Clarinet, the former is usually of larger scale, fuller and richer in tone. T\u00f6pfer, according to Audsley, describes it as a flue, not a reed, but no flue examples are known. It was often included in 19th century German instruments, usually as a free reed at 8' or 16', sometimes without resonators. It was uncommon in England, and was invariably made there as a striking reed. According to Sumner, Henry Willis I made hundreds of examples, which Audsley considered to be the most successful. While sometimes of inverted conical form, the resonators of the Bassethorn are usually cylindrical, sometimes with bells as shown in Audsley's illustration reproduced here.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Corno Bassetto, Soprano", "link": "CornoBassettoSoprano"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains five dozen examples of Corno di Bassetto, fourteen examples of Basset[t] Horn, and two of Cor de Basset.
