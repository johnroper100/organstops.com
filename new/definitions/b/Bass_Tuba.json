Bonavia-Hunt and Wedgwood report that the Tuba Profunda is a 16' Tuba Sonora, and Bonavia-Hunt lists Tuba Bass as a synonym. Audsley describes Bass Tuba,Contra Tuba and Tuba Profunda as synonyms for the most powerful 16' reed stop, having a \ufffdsingularly grand and impressive\ufffd tone, imitative of the orchestral instrument of the same name, speaking on 15\"-30\" of wind, and utilizing inverted-conical resonators of thick metal. Irwin lists Contra Tuba, Double Tuba and Tuba Profunda with the following description: A loud, penetrating, firm-toned Chorus Reed of 16' on the manuals, and 32' on the pedals. The rolling and brassy tone that comes from these long inverted-conical pipes (sometimes made from wood) is quite brilliant, but has varying degrees of clang-tone in the many examples heard. Its distnguishing mark is its firmness of pitch, although most examples lack the heavy ground tone of the Contra Bombarde. In theatre organs, according to Strony, the name Tuba Profunda is synonymous with Ophicleide, and is commonly used for the 16' Tuba Horn or Harmonic Tuba.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Tuba Profundissima", "link": "TubaProfundissima"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "No examples of Tuba Bass are known.
