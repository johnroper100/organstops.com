While most sources describe the body of the pipe as being conical, Sumner describes it as cylindrical. Wedgwood describes both forms, and reports that the conical form was invented by William Hill and used for his Viola da Gamba. Authorities differ as to its scale: Sumner says small, Audsley says medium, and Wedgwood says large. Audsley provides the illustration reproduced here (click on it for a larger image) and gives the following measurements for the middle c1 pipe: diameter at mouth1.39\" diameter at junction of bell 0.76\" diameter at top of bell1.27\" length of bell4\" length of bodyapprox. 21.5\" The forms of the pipes required that it be tuned using its large ears, bent inward to flatten or outward to sharpen. Reaching the mouths of the pipes could be extremely difficult, depending on the stop's placement on the windchest. The tone of the Bell Gamba has been described as \ufffddelicate\ufffd, \ufffdreedy\ufffd and similar to that of the orchestral Viola da Gamba. The stop is largely obsolete, owing to the difficulty in its construction, voicing and regulation. Audsley maintains that better tonal results can be obtained from simpler pipe forms.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "The earliest known example occurs under the name Gamba:", "examples": [{"link": "", "name": "Gamba 8', manual; Christ Episcopal Church, Rouses Point, New York, USA; Erben 1857.
