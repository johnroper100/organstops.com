It features a variety of pipe forms throughout its compass to imitate as closely as possible the tones of the entire range of orchestral flutes, from contrabass flute to piccolo. The pipe forms include harmonic, double harmonic, and double mouth constructions. The name Boehm Flute takes its name from Theobald B\u00f6hm, who developed the fingering system for the modern orchestral flute.
