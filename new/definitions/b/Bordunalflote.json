In some examples (the finer ones, according to Audsley and Sumner, who specify a medium scale), the pipes are of inverted pyramidal form, giving the tone a slight stringiness or reediness. The name is probably a corruption of Bourdon. Grove and Williams date this stop from the 17th century. Maclean lists Portunal and Portunalfl\u00f6te with the following description: It was a speciality of the reputable nineteenth century firm of Schlag & Sons, who introduced it into their organ at the Philharmonic Hall, Berlin. The tone was said to have had a veiled and velvety sound, with a suggestion of Clarinet quality in the lower part of its compass.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains six examples of Bordunalfl\u00f6te at 8' pitch, two examples of Portunalfl\u00f6te at 8' pitch and one at 4', one example of Portunal at each of 16', 8' and 4', and one example of Portunal Flute.
