{"images": [], "names": [{"name": "Bajete", "origin": "Spanish", "link": "", "primary": false}], "description": "Grove describes this stop as a 17th century Spanish reed, saying \ufffda 4' Bajete was gentle in tone\ufffd. Williams places it in the 18th century, saying that it often appeared only in the bass half of the traditionally split Spanish manuals, and that it could be en chamade. He agrees with Grove regarding its tone, comparing it with that of the Dulzian. Wedgwood, on the other hand, calls it \ufffda 4 ft. pedal flue stop (at Seville Cathedral)\ufffd. Wedgwood's definition is supported by the known examples (see below). The Spanish word means \ufffdbaritone\ufffd.
