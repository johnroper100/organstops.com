Its resonators are inverted conical metal or inverted pyramidal wood, and may be of harmonic (double) length in the treble. Bonavia-Hunt gives a scale of 7\"-8\" at 16' CCC, and says that they may be capped. The original Bombarde had a tone midway between that of the Trombone and the Fagotto, rather softer in tone than the modern stop. It is named after the medieval instrument, a loud treble double-reed still used in some regional folk musics. Wedgwood gives its etymology as deriving from the Latin bombus, meaning the buzzing of bees or the coarse blast of a trumpet, and the German brummen, meaning to growl or mutter. Grove describes Bombarde as the basic 16' reed in France, dating as far back as 1587, but Douglass says: \ufffdthe idea of using 16' reeds did not seem to appeal to builders until about 1690, when we have the earliest examples of the Bombarde 16'.\ufffd Dom Bedos calls it \ufffdthe most aggressive [stop] of all and possesses the fullest tone\ufffd, and goes on to say that it is used only in large organs, and is usually played from its own manual. The stop was known in Belgium as early as 1665 (see examples below). Adlung describes Bombarda as \ufffdalmost the same as a Sordun, except that the tone is altered as it emerges by little holes.\ufffd Regarding its tone, he says: \ufffdit rumbles like a Posaune, and is more penetrating than the Basson.\ufffd He lists as synonyms Bombarde, Pombarda, Pombart, Bombart, Bombardo, Bombardone, Pommer, and Bommer. Audsley lists this stop separately from the Bombard, but the difference is not clear. Wedgwood states, and Grove implies (rather unclearly) that Bombarde may be synonymous with Bombardon. Pommer is also a synonym for Gedecktpommer. The name Bombarde has also been used for entire manual divisions characterized by powerful reeds, starting in France in the 18th century. On theatre organs, the name Bombarde is used for a 16' Tuba Mirabilis.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Bombarde Quinte", "link": "BombardeQuinte"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "The only two examples of the reed form of Pommer are given below.
