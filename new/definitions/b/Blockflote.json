It is usually open metal, but sometimes of wood, and may be stopped, conical, or (according to Grove & Williams) harmonic. While Audsley and Grove claim that it is usually found at 4' pitch, those at 4' account for less than half the examples in Osiris (see below). Grove dates it from as early as 1620. Only Sumner explicitly equates this stop with Recorder. Wedgwood lists Plockfl\u00f6te and Bockfl\u00f6te as corruptions, but Audsley gives it a description consistent with Bokfl\u00f6te. The name Tibia Vulgaris means \ufffdcommon flute\ufffd; the name Weitpfeife derives from the German word weit meaning \ufffdwide\ufffd, probably referring to the scale. The names Blokfluit and Blokflojte do not appear in the literature, but we assume them to be synonyms.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [{"name": "Blockfl\u00f6tenbass", "link": "Blockflotenbass"}], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "Osiris contains about 300 examples of Blockfl\u00f6te, of which half are at 2' pitch, seven are at 1' pitch, two at 8', and the rest at 4', and the earliest of which are listed below.
