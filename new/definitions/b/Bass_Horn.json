Wedgwood describes the Bass Horn organ stop as an obsolete 8' pedal reed, similar in construction and tone to the Horn. Irwin describes it as a 16' pedal reed voiced to sound like the orchestral instrument of the same name, and claims that Tuba Horn is a synonym.", "construction": "", "usage": "", "variants": [], "comparisons": [], "examplesDescription": "No examples of", "examples": [], "soundClips": [], "bibliography": []}
