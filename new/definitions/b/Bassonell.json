Its tone was, in all probability, that of a soft Bassoon character. This is seemingly the stop referred to by Hamel under the Italian name Bassanello - \ufffdBassanelli. Ce sont des instruments \u00e0 vent du si\u00e8cle dernier [xviii]; ils resemblent beaucoup au chalumeau. Dans l'orgue, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 imit\u00e9s par des jeux d'anches particuliers de huit et de quatre pieds.\ufffd The French quotation translates as follows: \ufffdThey are wind instruments of the last century [18th]; they much resemble the shawm. In the organ, they were imitated by particular reed stops of eight and four feet.\ufffd Wedgwood describes Bassanelli thus: \ufffdWerkmeister states that these were reeds. They were obsolete even in his time [around 1700].\ufffd Examples All known examples are given below. Contributions welcome.
