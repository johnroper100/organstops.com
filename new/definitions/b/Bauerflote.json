Grove describes it as being usually open; according to Williams and Maclean it could be open, stopped, or a Rohrfl\u00f6te (especially at 1' pitch). All other sources describe it as stopped. Grove gives it a wide scale; Audsley and Wedgwood give it a small scale. It is made of wood, sometimes with chimneys in the stoppers. Its tone is clear, and in the higher pitches, whistle-like. In German organs it frequently appears in the pedal at 2' or 1' pitch, where it is used for playing the melody in choral preludes. Wedgwood claims it was sometimes called Choral-basset. According to Maclean the Bauernfl\u00f6te is usually found in the pedal, and its manual counterpart is the Feldfl\u00f6te. According to Adlung, it is often a type of Quintat\u00f6n, is sometimes considered the same as the Feldfl\u00f6te, is sometimes called Nachthorn, and is best constructed as a Rohrfl\u00f6te. Grove dates it from around 1550. The name Bauernfl\u00f6te means \ufffdpeasant flute\ufffd. The name Pileata Minima comes to us only by way of a footnote in Audsley's entry for Pileata in which he quotes Regnier, who states that the name Pileata Minima is used for all high-pitched covered stops.
